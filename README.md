# Persona-Poker: A Multi Agent Framework for Personalized Texas Hold em Playing Styles

## Introduction
While extensive research on Texas Hold’em has focused on game-theoretic optimal (GTO) strategies and computational approaches to decision-making, this work shifts the focus from pure strategy optimization to the impact of personalized behavior on player performance. Personalization encompasses a wide range of human-like attributes, including playing style (e.g., tight-aggressive or loose-passive), betting patterns, timing behavior, and even non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and body language—elements that are critical in real-world poker but often overlooked in traditional AI models.

To this end, we propose a personalized multi-agent framework in which each agent is endowed with distinct behavioral profiles and strategic tendencies that reflect diverse human playing styles. We further enhance the agents with memory mechanisms and context-aware decision-making modules, enabling them to adapt their actions based on historical interactions, table dynamics, and opponent behaviors. By simulating realistic psychological and strategic dimensions, our approach not only improves the believability of agent behavior but also allows for in-depth analysis of how personalization influences bluffing effectiveness, exploitability, and long-term performance in multi-agent Texas Hold’em environments.
