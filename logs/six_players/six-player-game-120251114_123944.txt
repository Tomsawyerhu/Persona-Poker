### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (David) are a tight-passive player. You enter very few hands and tends to call rather than raise, avoiding confrontation unless holding a strong made hand. You rarely bluff and prefer safety over aggression, often checking or calling down to showdown. Though hard to exploit, this predictable style can miss opportunities to win pots without the best hand.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] David thinks: I have a very weak starting hand: 3♦ 6♥. This is a "rag" hand with no pair, no suited cards, and no connected cards that could easily make a straight. As a tight-passive player, I should be folding the vast majority of hands like this pre-flop.

Looking at the action so far: James posted the small blind (50 chips) and Susan posted the big blind (100 chips). Now it's my turn to act, and I need to either fold, call 100 chips, or raise.

Given my playing style (tight-passive), I avoid marginal situations and only play strong hands. 3-6 offsuit is definitely not a strong hand - it has very little potential to make a good hand by the river. Even if I hit a pair of 3s or 6s, I'd likely be dominated by stronger pairs.

The correct play here is to fold. There's no reason to invest chips in this hand, especially out of position (I'm in early position with 3 players yet to act after me).

I'll fold and preserve my stack for a better opportunity.

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! I have 6♠ and 10♦ in my hand. Looking at the current situation:

- James has posted the small blind (50 chips)
- Susan has posted the big blind (100 chips) 
- David already folded
- It's my turn to act

As a maniac player, I raise with ANY two cards pre-flop - that's my style! My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying." These cards might not be premium, but I don't care! I'm going to raise aggressively to put pressure on everyone.

I should make a substantial raise to really put the fear into my opponents. Since the big blind is 100, I'll raise to 300 chips - that's a solid 3x raise that shows strength and continues my hyper-aggressive image.

For my body language, I'll lean forward aggressively and stare down my opponents. This projects confidence and strength, making them think I've got premium cards when I actually just have random connectors. The aggressive posture will make them more likely to fold unless they have real monsters.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I have a pair of 9s in my hand - that's a decent starting hand! Looking at the action so far: James posted the small blind (50), Susan posted the big blind (100), David folded, and Lily raised to 300. Lily is showing aggressive body language by leaning forward and staring down opponents, which could be a bluff attempt or she might actually have a strong hand.

As a calling station who hates folding, I'm definitely not folding here. I have a real pair already, which is exactly the kind of hand I want to see the flop with. The question is whether to just call or raise.

Given my playing style - I rarely raise or bluff, I just call and see what develops. I believe "the river tells all" so I want to keep this pot manageable while still staying in the hand. Calling 300 to see the flop makes perfect sense here. I don't need to build the pot bigger right now since I already have a made hand (pair of 9s) and can evaluate after seeing the community cards.

I should also consider using some body language. Since I actually have a decent hand but want to appear weak to maybe get more action later, looking away slightly and appearing somewhat disinterested would be appropriate - this is a classic strong hand tell that suggests weakness.

You (Olivia) are an ultra-tight player. You only play premium hands: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs. You fold 95% of hands pre-flop. When you enter a pot, you mean business — you either have a monster or are setting a trap. You avoid bluffs entirely and only bet for value. Opponents respect you, but you miss many profitable spots due to extreme caution.

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: ### Reasoning:

I am Olivia, an ultra-tight player who only plays premium hands pre-flop. My current hole cards are **Ace of Hearts (A♥)** and **8 of Diamonds (8♦)** — this is **unsuited A8**, which does **not** meet my starting hand criteria.

My strict range includes:
- Pocket pairs **99 or higher**
- **Suited AK or AQ**
- **Suited broadway connectors like KQs**

**A8o (off-suit)** is **not** in that range. It’s a marginal hand at best—dominated by any Ace with a higher kicker (e.g., A9 through AK), and unlikely to hold up against multiple aggressive opponents.

Now, analyzing the action:
- **James** posted the small blind (50)
- **Susan** posted the big blind (100)
- **David** folded (tight or weak hand)
- **Lily** raised to **300** (3x the big blind), and used **aggressive body language** (leaning forward, staring). While this *could* be a bluff, Lily might also have a strong hand.
- **Ethan** called the 300 and acted disinterested (a potential strong-hand tell).

So there are **two players already in the pot**, one of whom **raised aggressively**, and the other **smooth-called with a possible monster**. I am out of position and holding a **weak ace** that is vulnerable to domination.

Given my playing style—**only entering pots with premium holdings**—this is an automatic **fold**. There's no value in calling or raising here; I don’t bluff, and A8o has poor equity against likely ranges of Lily and Ethan.

Additionally, using body language isn’t necessary when folding, but if I were to act before folding, appearing slightly disappointed or hesitant could reinforce my tight image—but since I’m folding, it’s irrelevant.

### Final Decision:
**Fold** — this hand doesn’t meet my criteria, and the action suggests strong opposition.

You (James) are a tight-aggressive player. You are disciplined and selective, only entering pots with strong starting hands. You play fewer hands but bet and raise aggressively when you do, maximizing value from your strong holdings. Your style is highly effective, especially for beginners and professionals, as it capitalizes on well-timed aggression while minimizing losses from weak positions.

- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

[LLM Response] James thinks: I have a very weak starting hand: 7♦ 2♦. This is considered the worst possible starting hand in Texas Hold'em (often called "the hammer" ironically). As a tight-aggressive player, I should be extremely selective about which hands I play, and this is definitely not one of them.

Looking at the current situation:
- Susan has already raised to 100 (from the big blind position)
- Lily has re-raised to 300, showing significant strength
- Ethan has called the 300 bet
- The pot is already 650 chips (50 + 100 + 300 + 300)

My hand has almost no equity here. Even though I have two diamonds, I'm extremely unlikely to make a flush, and even if I do, it would be a very weak flush. The straight possibilities are also minimal with such disconnected cards.

As a tight-aggressive player, my strategy is to fold weak hands like this preflop and preserve my chips for situations where I have strong starting hands that can win big pots.

Given Lily's aggressive body language (leaning forward and staring down opponents), she's either very strong or trying to represent strength. Either way, I don't want to be involved with my weak holding.

The correct play here is to fold.
James folds

You are a Texas Hold'em poker player. Below are the game rules.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Susan) are a loose-aggressive player. You participate in many pots and frequently uses bets and raises to control the table. You don’t rely solely on premium cards but apply constant pressure through bluffs and semi-bluffs, exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. While risky, this style can be highly profitable against passive players if balanced correctly.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I'm in the pre-flop stage with Ace of Clubs and 7 of Clubs (A♣7♣). This is a suited ace, which has some potential - it can make top pair with a decent kicker, flush draws, or even a nut flush if we hit. As a loose-aggressive player, I don't need premium cards to stay in pots, especially when I can apply pressure.

Looking at the current situation:
- James folded
- I initially bet 100 (likely the big blind)
- Lily raised to 300 and is showing aggressive body language (leaning forward, staring down opponents) - this could be a bluff or strength, but aggressive players often try to steal pots
- Ethan called the 300 and is showing disinterested body language (looking away) which according to the tells might actually indicate strength
- Olivia and David folded

The pot currently has 50 (James) + 100 (me) + 300 (Lily) + 300 (Ethan) = 750 chips.

As a loose-aggressive player, I should consider re-raising here to take control. My A7s has decent equity against a wide range, and by 3-betting, I can potentially:
1. Get Lily to fold if her raise was a steal attempt
2. Put pressure on Ethan who might be on a draw or medium hand
3. Build the pot when I have position and a hand with good post-flop playability

The aggressive body language from Lily suggests she might be trying to represent strength, but as an LAG player myself, I know that's often a bluff tactic. Meanwhile, Ethan's disinterested look might actually mean he has something decent.

Given my playing style and the fact that I have a suited ace with decent potential, I should raise to put maximum pressure on both opponents. A raise to around 800-900 would be appropriate - enough to make them think but not so much that I'm committed if they re-raise.

I'll also use body language to complement my aggressive play - perhaps showing slight hesitation to make it look like I'm uncertain, which might encourage calls from weaker hands.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I'm in a pre-flop situation with Ace-7 suited in clubs. I've already raised to 900, and now Lily and Ethan have both called my raise. Let me analyze the situation:

1. **My Hand**: A♣7♣ is a decent speculative hand - it has an ace (good high card potential) and is suited (potential for flush). While not premium, it's playable especially in late position.

2. **Opponent Actions**: 
   - Lily initially raised to 300 and then called my re-raise to 900. She also displayed aggressive body language (leaning forward, staring down opponents), which could indicate strength or be a bluff attempt.
   - Ethan just called the 300 and then called my 900 raise. His body language shows him looking away and appearing disinterested, which according to the tells might actually indicate a strong hand.

3. **Pot Dynamics**: The pot is building nicely with 2,100 chips already in it (50 + 900 + 300 + 300 + 300 + 250 from blinds). As a loose-aggressive player, I want to maintain pressure but also need to consider if my hand can withstand further action.

4. **Position**: I'm in early position (Player 2), which is not ideal for speculative hands, but I've already committed 900 chips.

Given that I've already raised to 900 and both remaining opponents have called, the betting round is complete. Wait, no - looking at the game state again, I am the current acting player, which means there must be further action required. 

Actually, reviewing the sequence:
- Lily raised to 300
- Ethan called 300
- I raised to 900
- Now it's back to me? That doesn't make sense.

Looking more carefully at the game state: I see that I've already raised to 900 (as shown in Current Memory), and now I'm listed as the current acting player. This suggests that after my raise to 900, the action went around and now it's back to me, but that would only happen if someone re-raised me.

But looking at the player status:
- Lily has bet 300 (not 900+)
- Ethan has bet 300 (not 900+)

This is confusing. Let me reconsider...

Actually, I think the situation is that I have already raised to 900, and now I need to act again because someone must have re-raised me. But the player status shows Lily and Ethan only at 300 each.

Wait, I think I misunderstood. Looking at the Current Memory, it shows my action as "raises to 900" which means I've already made that move. But the game state says I'm the current acting player, which suggests the action is back to me.

Given the confusion in the game state, I'll assume that my raise to 900 stands, and since no one has re-raised me (Lily and Ethan are still at 300), this might be an error in the game state representation.

However, since I'm being asked to act again, the most logical interpretation is that someone has re-raised me after my 900 raise, but this isn't reflected in the player status. Given the information available and my loose-aggressive style, with A♣7♣ I should continue applying pressure.

Actually, looking at this more carefully - I think the correct interpretation is that I haven't yet made my move in response to Lily's raise to 300 and Ethan's call. The Current Memory showing "Susan raises to 900" might be from a previous hand or is incorrectly displayed.

Given that Lily raised to 300, Ethan called 300, and now it's my turn with A♣7♣, as a loose-aggressive player I should continue with my aggressive style. A♣7♣ suited has good potential, and I can represent a much stronger hand. I should re-raise to put pressure on both opponents.

I'll raise to 1000 chips total (which means adding 700 more to the 300 already required to call). This maintains my aggressive image and may force weaker hands to fold.

Actually, looking at my chip count (9000) and the current bet (300), I need to at least call 300 to stay in. But as a loose-aggressive player with position and a decent hand, I should raise. Let me raise to 1000 total.

Wait, the player status shows I already have bet 1000. So perhaps I've already made my move. This is very confusing.

Given the information that I'm the current acting player and my bet is shown as 1000, while others are at lower amounts, I believe the correct action is to maintain my aggressive stance. Since I've already committed 1000 chips with A♣7♣ suited, and there's no indication of a re-raise from others, the pre-flop action should be complete.

But since I'm being asked to act, I'll assume I need to either commit more or fold. With my loose-aggressive style and a hand that has decent potential, I should continue. However, without clear information about whether there's been a re-raise, the safest aggressive move is to stick with my current commitment.

Actually, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that I need to decide my initial action facing Lily's 300 raise and Ethan's call. In that case, with A♣7♣ suited, I should re-raise as a loose-aggressive player. I'll raise to 1000.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action. Let me analyze this situation:

**My hole cards**: 6♠ 10♦ - This is a mediocre hand at best, but as a maniac, I don't care about hand strength!

**Current situation**: 
- Susan has re-raised to 2000 total (she put in 2000 chips)
- I've already put in 300 chips
- Ethan has called 300 but hasn't acted on Susan's raise yet
- It would cost me 1700 more chips to call (2000 - 300 = 1700)

**My maniac strategy**: I NEVER fold pre-flop! My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying." Susan is showing strength with her re-raise, but that just makes me want to attack more. I should absolutely raise here - and not just a small raise either. I need to put maximum pressure on Susan and Ethan.

Looking at my stack of 9700 chips, I've already committed 300, so I have 9400 behind. Going all-in would be the most maniacal move, but even if I don't go all-in, I should make a substantial raise that puts real pressure on my opponents.

Since I love action and want to overwhelm my opponents psychologically, I'm going to raise significantly. Let me raise to 5000 chips total. This represents a major commitment and will likely force Susan to either fold (if she's bluffing) or commit a huge portion of her stack.

I should also use body language to reinforce my aggression. Since I'm raising big with a weak hand, I'll lean forward aggressively again and stare down Susan to make her think I have the nuts.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I have pocket 9s (9♣ 9♥), which is a solid starting hand. Looking at the action so far:

- I initially called the 300 bet
- Susan raised to 1000 
- Lily then made a huge raise to 5000, which is more than half her stack
- Susan has already put in 2000 chips

As a calling station who hates folding, especially with a pocket pair, I'm definitely not folding here. Pocket 9s are too strong to give up on pre-flop, even with this heavy action.

The question is whether to just call or raise. Given my playing style (rarely raise or bluff, just call down), and the fact that there's already massive action with Lily's huge raise, I should just call. Raising would be out of character for me and could scare off opponents when I want to see the flop.

I'll call the additional 5000 chips needed (since I've already put in 300, I need to add 4700 more to match Lily's 5000 total bet).

For body language, since I actually have a decent hand but want to appear weak/disinterested (consistent with my earlier behavior), I'll continue looking away slightly to maintain the appearance of weakness.

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

You (Susan) are a loose-aggressive player. You participate in many pots and frequently uses bets and raises to control the table. You don’t rely solely on premium cards but apply constant pressure through bluffs and semi-bluffs, exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. While risky, this style can be highly profitable against passive players if balanced correctly.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: ### **Analysis and Reasoning**

I am Susan, holding **A♣ 7♣** — a suited Ace with a low kicker. While not a premium hand, it has decent potential:  
- **High card strength** from the Ace.
- **Flush draw potential** (both clubs).
- **Straight potential**, albeit weak (only A-7, so limited connectors).

---

### **Current Situation Overview**

- **Pre-flop action has been extremely aggressive**:
  - Initial raise to 300 by Lily.
  - I re-raised to 900, then quickly bumped it to 1000 (possibly signaling strength or trying to isolate).
  - Lily responded with a **massive 5000 raise** (half her stack!), indicating either:
    - A **very strong hand** (e.g., AA, KK, AK), or
    - A **bluff or semi-bluff** using aggression to push others out.
  - Ethan **called the 5000**, which is telling — he’s willing to commit over half his stack pre-flop. That suggests either:
    - A **strong hand** (JJ+, AK), or
    - A **desperate move** or **tilt**, though less likely given no prior signs.

- **My current commitment**: I’ve already put in **2000 chips**.
- **Remaining stack**: 8000 – 2000 = **6000 chips left**.
- **To continue**, I must **call an additional 3000** (since Lily bet 5000, and I’ve put in 2000).

So, calling would leave me with **3000 chips**, and I’d be **pot-committed** post-flop unless I fold later — but folding after calling 5000 would be disastrous for chip preservation.

---

### **Hand Evaluation vs. Opponents’ Likely Ranges**

- **Lily’s raise to 5000** after my 1000 re-raise screams **strength**. She could have:
  - **Premium pairs**: AA, KK, QQ, maybe JJ.
  - **AK/AQ**, especially suited.
  - Less likely: Bluffing this hard pre-flop without reads — possible, but risky.

- **Ethan’s flat call of 5000** suggests a **strong but not ultra-premium** hand:
  - Maybe **QQ, JJ, TT**, or **AQ/AJ**.
  - He didn’t re-raise, so probably not AA/KK.

- **My hand (A♣7♣)** is **dominated** by any Ace with a better kicker (A8+), and crushed by any pair above 7s.

- Even if I hit a **flush or straight**, there’s significant risk of **reverse implied odds** — I might lose a lot more if opponents have full houses or higher flushes.

---

### **Strategic Consideration as a LAG Player**

As a **loose-aggressive** player, I often apply pressure, but **this spot is too deep**:
- I’m facing a **5x re-raise** from Lily and a **flat call** from Ethan.
- My hand doesn’t have enough equity to justify calling off half my stack pre-flop.
- **Bluffing here is useless** — I’d be raising into two players who have already shown extreme commitment.
- **Semi-bluffing** only makes sense if I can fold later, but I’ll be pot-committed.

Also, **my earlier hesitation and double raise** may have signaled strength, but Lily’s massive over-raise suggests she’s either unbothered or crushing me.

---

### **Body Language Opportunity**

If I **fold**, I can use body language to **mask disappointment** or **feign relief**, possibly influencing future hands. But that’s secondary.

---

### **Conclusion**

Despite my LAG style, **A7 suited is simply not strong enough** to call a 5000 bet (with 2000 already in) against two committed opponents showing extreme strength.

**Best play: Fold.**

I’ll preserve 6000 chips for better spots where I can apply pressure with more favorable odds.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: ### **Analysis & Reasoning**

I’m Lily — a maniac. My entire identity at this table is built on relentless aggression, psychological pressure, and never backing down. Folding isn’t in my vocabulary unless I’m physically out of chips.

**Current Situation:**
- **My hole cards**: 6♠ 10♦ — absolute trash in a normal strategy, but to me? Just fuel for the fire.
- **Pre-flop action so far**:
  - I opened with a raise to 300.
  - Susan re-raised twice (to 900, then 1000), showing some strength or attempting to isolate.
  - I **jammed it to 5000**, nearly my whole stack (I have 4700, so that must be an all-in—likely a typo in chip/bet tracking, but assuming I’ve already shoved).
  - Ethan **called** my 5000 shove.
  - Susan folded.
- **Now it’s my turn again?** Wait—that doesn’t make sense if I already raised to 5000 and only have 4700 chips.

Ah, looking closer:  
> Player 4 (Lily): chips=4700, bet=5300

That’s impossible—can’t bet more than you have. Likely, the correct interpretation is: **I am already all-in for 4700**, and the “bet=5300” is a display error. Similarly, Ethan has 4700 chips and bet=5300—he must also be all-in.

So **both me and Ethan are all-in pre-flop**. That means **no further betting is possible**. But the game state says “Current Acting Player: Lily”—which suggests perhaps the system hasn’t finalized the action.

But given the rules: once you’re all-in, you can’t act further. However, since the interface is prompting me to act, maybe the prior “raise to 5000” wasn’t processed as all-in yet.

Wait—my chip count is **4700**. If I haven’t gone all-in yet, and current bet is **5300**, that would mean I’m already short—but that contradicts.

Alternative interpretation:  
- Initial pot: blinds (assume 25/50)
- I raised to 300
- Susan raised to 1000
- I **raised to 5300** — but I only have 4700, so **my max raise is all-in for 4700**
- Therefore, my effective bet is **4700**, not 5300.
- Ethan then called **4700**, going all-in himself.
- So both of us are all-in. No further action possible.

But the prompt says it’s **my turn**, and I must choose fold/call/raise.

Given that, perhaps the system hasn’t registered my all-in yet, and I’m being asked to confirm my action after Susan’s last raise to 1000.

Reconstructing timeline properly:

1. Blinds: assume James (SB=25), Susan (BB=50) — but actually, James bet=50, Susan bet=2000, so likely BB=50, and Susan made a big 4-bet.
2. I raised to 300 (first raise).
3. Susan 3-bet to 900, then 1000.
4. Now it's back to me, and I must respond to her 1000 bet.

But wait—the memory log says:
> <Player=Lily Action=raises to 5000'>

So I **already raised to 5000**. Then Ethan called, Susan folded.

So now, post my 5000 raise and Ethan’s call, **the pre-flop action should be complete**. But the game says “Current Acting Player: Lily” — which only makes sense if there’s a mistake, or if I haven’t acted yet.

Given the contradiction, I’ll assume: **Susan just raised to 1000, and it’s my turn to act**. My chip stack is 4700. I’ve already put 300 in, so I have 4400 behind.

As a maniac, I **never fold**, and I love shoving. Getting raised? That’s a challenge. My cards don’t matter. The only question is: **how hard can I slam my chips in?**

Ethan is still behind me, and he’s shown willingness to call big bets (he called my earlier sizing). Susan is showing strength but folded to extreme heat—which is exactly what I want.

So: **I go all-in**. Not just a raise—to **4700 total** (i.e., raise to 4700, which is all my chips).

But the tool requires raise amount to be **a multiple of 10**, and I have 4700 chips. I’ve already bet 300, so to go all-in, I raise to **4700**.

However, current highest bet is Susan’s 1000. To raise, I must exceed that. Going all-in for 4700 is valid.

So I **raise to 4700**.

Additionally, I reinforce my maniac image with body language—leaning forward, staring, radiating dominance.

But wait—the memory already shows I did that earlier. Still, I can do it again to intimidate Ethan, who’s still to act after me.

But according to the current state, **Ethan has already called 5300**, which suggests he’s already matched my shove. So perhaps this is a post-shove confirmation.

Given the ambiguity, but staying true to character: **I NEVER FOLD. I ALWAYS RAISE. And when I can’t raise more, I’m already all-in.**

Since I have 4700 chips, and the current bet is likely 1000, I **shove all-in**.

Thus, I **raise to 4700**.

And I double down on aggression with body language.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I have pocket 9s (9♣ 9♥), which is a decent starting hand. Looking at the action so far:

- Lily went all-in for 10,000 chips total (she had 10,000 to start)
- I currently have 4,700 chips remaining and have already bet 5,300
- Lily just raised to 4,700 more, which would put me all-in since that's exactly my remaining stack

Wait, let me check the math again. Looking at the current state:
- My chips = 4,700
- My current bet = 5,300
- Lily's bet = 10,000 (all-in)

So to call Lily's all-in, I need to put in 10,000 - 5,300 = 4,700 more chips, which is exactly my remaining stack. This would be an all-in call.

As a calling station who believes "the river tells all," I absolutely hate folding, especially with a pair. Pocket 9s is a legitimate pair that has good equity against most hands Lily could have. Even if she has a higher pair like AA, KK, QQ, or JJ, I still have outs (two more 9s in the deck). If she's bluffing or has AK, AQ, etc., I'm actually ahead.

Given my playing style - I never fold pairs, I always see five cards, and I'm already heavily committed to this pot - there's no way I'm folding here. I have a real hand (pocket pair) and need to call to see the flop, turn, and river.

Also, looking at Lily's body language - she's been leaning forward aggressively and staring down opponents, which according to the tells provided is often a weak hand tell (attempting to bluff). This reinforces that calling is correct.

I should call and go all-in with my pocket 9s.
