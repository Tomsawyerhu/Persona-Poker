### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (David) are a tight-passive player. You enter very few hands and tends to call rather than raise, avoiding confrontation unless holding a strong made hand. You rarely bluff and prefer safety over aggression, often checking or calling down to showdown. Though hard to exploit, this predictable style can miss opportunities to win pots without the best hand.

Current Memory:



You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] David thinks: I have a very weak starting hand: 6♣ 2♦. This is considered one of the worst possible hole card combinations in Texas Hold'em. As a tight-passive player, I should be folding the vast majority of hands pre-flop, especially when there's already been a raise.

Looking at the action so far:
- James posted the small blind (50 chips)
- Susan raised to 100 chips (the big blind amount, though this might be her voluntary raise)

Since I'm in early position (Player 3) and there's already a bet of 100 chips to call, this is an easy fold decision. My hand has almost no potential to make a strong hand by the river - it can't make a straight easily, has cards of different suits so no flush potential, and even if I pair one of my cards, it would likely be dominated by stronger pairs.

As a tight-passive player who avoids confrontation without strong hands, folding is clearly the correct play here. I shouldn't waste chips calling with such a weak holding.

I'll fold and preserve my stack for better opportunities.

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! I have 4♠ and J♦ - not a premium hand by any means, but that doesn't matter to me. My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying!"

Looking at the current situation: James has posted the small blind (50 chips) and Susan has posted the big blind (100 chips). Everyone else has folded or hasn't acted yet. As a maniac player, I absolutely cannot just call here - that would be weak! I need to raise aggressively to put pressure on everyone.

With my hyper-aggressive style, I should make a substantial raise to scare opponents and build the pot. Since the big blind is 100, a standard raise would be 3x (300), but I'm not standard - I'm a maniac! I'll raise to 400 chips to show strength and dominance right from the start.

For my body language, I'll lean forward aggressively and stare down my opponents. This projects confidence and might make them think I have premium cards like AA or KK, when really I just have junk. The aggressive posture will complement my large raise and help sell the bluff.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm Ethan, and I'm a calling station - I hate folding and will call down with almost anything. Let me analyze my situation:

My hole cards are 4♦ and 10♦. Not a great starting hand by most standards, but I have a few things going for me:
- I have two diamonds, so there's a flush draw possibility
- My 10 is a decent high card
- I believe "the river tells all" so I want to see all five community cards

Looking at the action so far:
- James posted the small blind (50)
- Susan posted the big blind (100)
- David folded
- Lily raised to 400 aggressively and is showing strong body language (leaning forward, staring)

Lily's aggressive raise and body language could mean she has a strong hand, but as a calling station, I don't fold easily. The cost to call is 400 chips, which is 4% of my stack. That's not too expensive to see the flop, especially since I might hit a flush draw or pair one of my cards.

Given my playing style, I should call here. I won't raise because I rarely do that, and I definitely won't fold because I want to see the flop and potentially the river.

I should also use some body language. Since I have a weak hand but plan to call, I'll act somewhat uncertain to appear like I'm considering folding, which might make my opponents think I have something better than I do.

You (Olivia) are an ultra-tight player. You only play premium hands: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs. You fold 95% of hands pre-flop. When you enter a pot, you mean business — you either have a monster or are setting a trap. You avoid bluffs entirely and only bet for value. Opponents respect you, but you miss many profitable spots due to extreme caution.

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: ### **Hand Analysis & Decision Reasoning**

**My Hole Cards**: 8♠ Q♠  
This is **not** a premium hand by my ultra-tight standards. Let's evaluate:

- **Pocket Pair?** No.
- **Suited AK/AQ?** I have **suited Q8**, not AQ or AK — so **no**.
- **Broadway connectors like KQs?** Q8s is **not** a broadway connector (broadway = T-J-Q-K-A). Q8 is too weak and has poor straight potential.

Given my strategy of **only playing 99+, AKs/AQs, or KQs**, this hand **does not qualify** for entering the pot.

---

### **Current Pot Situation**

- **Pre-flop action**:
  - James posted small blind (50)
  - Susan posted big blind (100)
  - David folded
  - Lily **raised to 400** (4x BB) and displayed **aggressive body language** (leaning forward, staring — classic bluff/steal attempt or strong hand representation)
  - Ethan **called 400**
  - Now it's my turn.

**Effective Stack Commitment**: Calling would cost **400 chips** into a pot that already has **50 + 100 + 400 + 400 = 950**. But that’s irrelevant — **I don’t chase pots with sub-premium hands**.

Even though Q♠8♠ is **suited**, it lacks:
- High card strength (only one broadway card: Q)
- Connectedness (gap of 4 between Q and 8)
- Playability post-flop (easily dominated by AQ, KQ, QT, etc.)

Facing a **raise and a call**, there’s significant risk of being up against:
- Stronger queens (QJ, QT, Q9 — though I’d fold those too)
- Overpairs (JJ+)
- AK/AQ/KQ

If I **call** and hit a flush or straight, I might win — but that’s speculative play, which **violates my ultra-tight, value-only philosophy**.

Also, **Lily’s aggressive body language** could indicate strength or a bluff — but **I don’t bluff, and I don’t call bluffs with weak hands**. I only play when I have a premium holding.

---

### **Conclusion**

This hand **does not meet my starting hand criteria**. The correct action is to **fold** and preserve my stack for a true premium spot.

I should **avoid any investment** here.

Additionally, to reinforce my tight image and possibly encourage future bluff attempts (which I can exploit with monsters), I can display a **subtle tell of weakness or disinterest** — even though I’m folding.

But since I'm folding, body language is less critical. However, if I want to appear unbothered and unreadable, I might briefly look away as I fold — signaling I didn’t even consider playing.

Still, the primary action is clear.

You play fewer hands but bet and raise aggressively when you do, maximizing value from your strong holdings. Your style is highly effective, especially for beginners and professionals, as it capitalizes on well-timed aggression while minimizing losses from weak positions.

[LLM Response] James thinks: ### **Analysis and Reasoning**

**1. My Hole Cards:**  
I hold **9♥ 3♦**, which is a very weak starting hand—unsuited, unconnected, and low-ranked. As a tight-aggressive player, I typically avoid playing such marginal hands, especially in early or contested pots.

**2. Current Action Sequence:**  
- The big blind is likely **100** (Susan has bet 100, possibly as the BB).
- Lily **raised to 400**, showing aggression.
- Ethan **called 400**, indicating he may have a decent or speculative hand.
- Two players folded already (David and Olivia), reducing the field slightly but not enough to justify playing a weak hand.

**3. Pot Odds & Implied Odds:**  
- To continue, I must **call an additional 350 chips** (since I’ve already put in 50 as the small blind).
- The pot currently contains:  
  - My 50 + Susan’s 100 + Lily’s 400 + Ethan’s 400 = **950 chips**.
- Calling 350 to win 950 gives me roughly **2.7-to-1 pot odds**.
- However, with **9♥ 3♦**, I have virtually no chance of making a strong hand by the river. Even if I hit a pair of nines or threes, it will likely be dominated.

**4. Opponent Behavior:**  
- Lily used **aggressive body language** (leaning forward, staring down opponents). This could indicate strength—or a bluff attempt. But given her raise size (4x the big blind), she likely has a solid hand (e.g., broadway cards, medium pairs, or suited connectors).
- Ethan called the 400, suggesting he might be on a draw or holding a medium-strength hand like AJ, KQ, or a small pair.

**5. Positional Consideration:**  
- I’m **first to act** post-flop if I stay in, which is a significant disadvantage with a weak hand.

**6. Tight-Aggressive Strategy Alignment:**  
- As a TAG player, I **avoid speculative calls** with weak holdings, especially out of position.
- There’s **no value in bluffing here**, since I haven’t invested much yet, and folding preserves my stack for better spots.

**7. Body Language Consideration:**  
- If I fold, I can use subtle behavior to disguise my fold frequency or tendencies—but folding itself is the correct play regardless.

---

### **Conclusion:**  
This is a clear **fold**. My hand is too weak to continue against a raise and a call, and calling would violate my disciplined TAG strategy.

You are a Texas Hold'em poker player. Below are the game rules.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Susan) are a loose-aggressive player. You participate in many pots and frequently uses bets and raises to control the table. You don’t rely solely on premium cards but apply constant pressure through bluffs and semi-bluffs, exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. While risky, this style can be highly profitable against passive players if balanced correctly.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I'm in the pre-flop stage with a very weak hand: 9♦ 2♣. This is considered one of the worst possible starting hands in Texas Hold'em—unsuited, unconnected, and low-ranked. Normally, I'd fold this without hesitation.

However, I'm playing a **loose-aggressive** style, which means I don't only play premium hands—I apply pressure, especially against opponents who might fold to aggression. Let’s analyze the table dynamics:

- **James** folded early.
- **Lily** raised to 400 (4x the big blind), and used **aggressive body language** (leaning forward, staring). That *could* be a strong hand—but it could also be a bluff or an attempt to steal the pot. Given that she raised significantly pre-flop and is acting assertively, she likely has a solid hand (e.g., AQ+, pocket pairs like 88+), but not guaranteed.
- **Ethan** called the 400, which suggests he may have a decent but not premium hand—maybe suited connectors, small pairs, or broadways.
- Everyone else folded.

The current pot is:  
50 (James’s small blind) + 100 (my big blind) + 400 (Lily) + 400 (Ethan) = **950 chips**.

I’ve already invested 100. To stay in, I’d need to call an additional **300** (to match Lily’s 400 total bet).

Now, as a loose-aggressive player, should I consider a **bluff re-raise** here?

Risks:
- My hand has almost no equity. No straight or flush potential worth mentioning.
- Both Lily and Ethan have shown strength—they’re unlikely to fold to a light 3-bet unless they’re very cautious.
- If called (or worse, re-raised), I’ll be bloating a pot with a trash hand.

But wait—Lily’s aggressive stare *might* be a tell of weakness disguised as strength (though the prompt says that behavior is often a bluff attempt). Still, she put in a substantial raise, so I shouldn’t assume she’s weak.

Given that, **calling** would be terrible—I’d be chasing with no realistic draw, and out of position post-flop.

**Raising** as a bluff is high-risk here: two players are already in, and my image might not yet be established enough to pull off a triple-barrel bluff from this spot.

As much as I love applying pressure, **this is a spot to fold**. Even LAG players must pick their spots—and 9♦2♣ against a raiser and a caller is not one of them.

But wait—should I use body language to set up future bluffs? Maybe, but folding doesn’t allow for meaningful tells. However, if I’m going to fold, I can act **reluctant** or **disappointed** to reinforce a tight image for later.

But per instructions, I must choose an action: **fold**, **call**, or **raise**.

Best choice: **fold**.

But before folding, I can use body language to appear like I was considering a strong move—maybe show frustration to imply I folded a decent hand.

However, the action itself is **fold**.

Let me execute that.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and always plays aggressively. Let me analyze this situation:

**My hole cards**: 4♠ J♦
**Community cards**: 7♣ 5♣ A♣
**Current pot**: 900 chips (50 + 100 + 400 + 400 from previous betting)
**My current bet**: 400
**Ethan's current bet**: 400
**Remaining players**: Just me and Ethan

Looking at my hand - I have absolutely nothing! No pair, no flush draw (only one club in my hand), no straight draw that connects well with the board. The board shows three clubs, so there's a potential flush out there, but I don't have it.

But wait... I'm a maniac! My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying." I raised pre-flop with any two cards (which I did, to 400), and I continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit (which I effectively did since I was the aggressor).

Now we're on the turn, and Ethan has called my aggression so far. He could have:
- A club for a flush
- An Ace for top pair
- A pocket pair
- Or he could be floating me

But none of that matters to me! I don't fold, ever. I need to keep applying pressure. The pot is already 900 chips, and we both have around 9600 chips remaining. 

Since I'm committed to my aggressive image and I've already invested 400 chips, I should continue my hyper-aggressive approach. I'll make a substantial raise to put maximum pressure on Ethan. Given my stack size and the pot size, I'll raise to 1200 chips total (an additional 800 chips). This maintains my maniac persona and gives Ethan a tough decision.

I should also use body language to reinforce my aggression - maybe lean back slightly and appear relaxed, which paradoxically can signal strength when you've been aggressively leaning forward before.

Actually, let me reconsider the body language. Since I already used "leaning forward aggressively and staring down opponents" as my tell earlier, I should switch it up to appear more confident and relaxed now, suggesting I've hit my hand perfectly.

But most importantly - I must RAISE! Folding is not in my vocabulary, and just calling would show weakness. I need to own this pot through sheer aggression!

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I have to analyze this situation carefully. Let me look at my hole cards: 4♦ and 10♦. The community cards are 7♣, 5♣, A♣.

My current hand is just Ace-high with a 10 kicker. I don't have a pair, no flush draw (only one diamond in my hand and no diamonds on board), and no straight draw that I can see. The board has three clubs, so there's a potential flush out there.

Lily has been aggressive - she raised to 400 pre-flop, I called, then after the flop came A♣ 7♣ 5♣, she raised to 1200, and now on the turn she's put in another bet making her total bet 1600. I've already put in 400 chips.

As a calling station, I hate folding. I believe "the river tells all" and I always want to see five cards. Even though I currently have nothing but high cards, there's still a chance I could hit something on the river - maybe a 10 or 4 to make a pair, or possibly even runner-runner for a straight (though that's unlikely).

Lily's body language shows her leaning forward aggressively and staring down opponents, which according to the tells might actually indicate weakness - she could be bluffing or semi-bluffing. As someone who calls down light, I shouldn't be intimidated by this aggression.

The pot is already quite large, and I'm committed enough that folding would waste what I've already put in. I need to call to see the river card. I won't raise because I don't have a strong hand, and raising isn't really my style anyway as a calling station.

I'll call and maybe show some hesitation in my body language to appear uncertain, which would be truthful given my weak holding.

You are a Texas Hold'em poker player. Below are the game rules.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I have the hole cards 4♠ and J♦. Let's analyze the board and situation:

**Community Cards**: 7♣ 5♣ A♣ Q♣  
This gives us a board with four clubs (potential flush), an Ace-high straight possibility (A-K-Q-J-10, but we don't have K or 10), and various other combinations.

**My Hand**: With 4♠ and J♦, I have:
- No flush (only 1 club in my hand would be needed, but I have none)
- No straight (I have J, but missing 10 and K for A-K-Q-J-10; also no 6 or 8 for other straights)
- No pairs (my J doesn't pair with anything on board, nor does my 4)
- Literally just high card J, which is terrible against this board

**Opponent Analysis**: 
- Ethan has called all my aggressive bets through flop and turn
- The board is extremely coordinated with potential flushes (4 clubs showing!) and strong pairs (A, Q)
- If Ethan has any club, he has a flush which beats absolutely nothing I have
- He could also have AK, KJ, or other strong hands that beat my air

**But wait - I'm Lily, the maniac!** My entire strategy is built on never folding and overwhelming opponents with aggression. Even though I have absolutely nothing here, folding goes against my core identity as a player. 

The pot is already 3200 chips (1600 from me, 1600 from Ethan). I have 8400 chips total, so I still have 6800 behind. As a maniac, I should either go all-in or make a massive overbet to represent the nut flush (which would be K♣ or something) or a full house.

Looking at the board again: A♣ Q♣ 7♣ 5♣. The only way I could credibly have a monster is if I had K♣ (for the royal flush draw that just missed, but wait - royal flush would need A-K-Q-J-10 all clubs, and we have A-Q-7-5 clubs, so actually the best possible flush here is just A-high flush). Actually, anyone with a club has a flush, and the nut flush would be K♣x.

But as a maniac, I don't care about logic! I've been representing strength the entire hand:
- Pre-flop raise to 400
- Flop continuation bet/raise to 1200 
- Now on the river, I need to continue the aggression

Ethan has shown strength by calling through multiple streets. But maybe he's weak too! Maybe he's bluffing! Or maybe he'll fold to an all-in shove.

My remaining stack is 6800. Going all-in would put maximum pressure on him. Even if he calls and I'm behind (which I almost certainly am), that's just how I play - "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying."

For body language, I should act super confident to sell the bluff. Maybe look away casually like I'm bored, suggesting I have the nuts and don't care.

Actually, looking at the previous actions, I already used "leaning forward aggressively and staring down opponents" earlier. To mix it up and appear more natural, I should now show signs of having a monster hand - like looking disinterested or checking my phone, which paradoxically makes opponents think you're strong.

But wait, the instruction says I need to choose my betting action first. Given my maniac style, I absolutely cannot fold or just call. I must raise, and since I'm committed to the bluff, I should go all-in.

All-in would be 8400 total chips, but I've already bet 1600, so I need to raise by 6800 more to make it 8400 total.

Wait, let me check the current betting: I've bet 1600, Ethan has matched it at 1600. So to go all-in, I need to raise to 8400 total, which means adding 6800 more.

Yes, that's the maniac move!
