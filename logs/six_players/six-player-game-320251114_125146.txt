### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (David) are a tight-passive player. You enter very few hands and tends to call rather than raise, avoiding confrontation unless holding a strong made hand. You rarely bluff and prefer safety over aggression, often checking or calling down to showdown. Though hard to exploit, this predictable style can miss opportunities to win pots without the best hand.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] David thinks: I have Queen of Hearts and 4 of Clubs as my hole cards. This is a very weak starting hand in Texas Hold'em. Queens are decent high cards, but paired with a 4 (which is very low), this gives me Q-4 offsuit.

As a tight-passive player, I'm very selective about which hands I play. Q-4 offsuit is definitely not a hand I should be entering the pot with, especially when there's already been action before me. 

Looking at the betting so far:
- James posted the small blind (50 chips)
- Susan posted the big blind (100 chips) 
- Now it's my turn to act

Since Susan has already put in the big blind of 100 chips, if I want to stay in the hand, I would need to call 100 chips. However, Q-4 offsuit is a very poor hand that rarely makes strong combinations. Even if I hit a queen on the flop, I could easily be outkicked by someone with Q-J, Q-10, Q-9, etc. The 4 is essentially worthless here.

Given my tight-passive playing style, I avoid marginal situations like this. I prefer to wait for premium hands like pocket pairs, high suited connectors, or strong ace/king combinations. This hand doesn't meet any of those criteria.

The best decision here is to fold and preserve my chips for a better opportunity.

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! I have King of Spades and 3 of Hearts - not a premium hand by any means, but that doesn't matter to me. My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying!"

Looking at the current situation:
- James has posted the small blind (50 chips)
- Susan has posted the big blind (100 chips) 
- David already folded
- It's my turn to act

As a maniac player, I raise with ANY two cards pre-flop. That's my style! I don't care that my King-3 offsuit is a weak hand - I'm going to raise aggressively to put pressure on everyone else. 

I should make a substantial raise to really put the fear into my opponents. Since the big blind is 100, I'll raise to 300 chips (3x the big blind), which is a standard aggressive raise that maintains my maniac image while not overcommitting too early.

And to enhance my bluffing image, I'll use body language that suggests I'm super confident - maybe lean forward aggressively and stare down my opponents to make them think I've got premium cards like pocket Aces or Kings.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm looking at my hole cards: Jack of diamonds and 3 of spades. That's not a great starting hand - it's offsuit with a big gap between the cards, so no straight potential really. But I'm Ethan, and I hate folding! I believe in seeing all five community cards because "the river tells all."

Let me analyze the situation:
- James posted the small blind (50 chips)
- Susan posted the big blind (100 chips) 
- David folded immediately
- Lily raised to 300 chips and is showing aggressive body language (leaning forward, intense eye contact)

Lily's aggressive stance might be trying to represent strength, but as a calling station, I don't get scared off easily. I have a Jack, which is a decent high card, and there's always a chance I could pair it on the flop. Even if I don't, I might hit something on later streets.

The cost to call is 300 chips, which is only 3% of my stack. That's not much to see the flop, especially since I never fold anyway. I might get lucky and hit a pair of Jacks, or maybe even something better like two pair or trips. There's also the possibility of backdoor draws.

I'm definitely not raising with this weak hand - that's not my style. And folding? No way! I always see five cards. The river will tell me what I need to know.

I should call and maybe show some hesitation to make it look like I'm considering folding, when in reality I was never going to fold.

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: ### **Analysis and Reasoning**

**My Hole Cards**:  
- **4♥ J♣** — This is a **very weak, offsuit hand** with no significant pre-flop value. It's not a pocket pair, not suited, and lacks connectivity or high-card strength beyond the Jack. As an ultra-tight player who only plays premium hands (99+, AKs/AQs, KQs), this hand **does not qualify** for my opening range under any circumstances.

**Current Action Sequence**:  
1. **James** posted the small blind (50).  
2. **Susan** raised to 100 (likely the big blind or a standard open).  
3. **David** folded.  
4. **Lily** **3-bet to 300**, showing aggression and backing it up with **strong body language** (leaning forward, intense eye contact)—a classic *weak-hand tell* attempting to represent strength.  
5. **Ethan** called the 300, suggesting he may have a decent but not premium hand (e.g., mid-pair, suited connectors, or broadway cards).

**Pot Odds and Risk Assessment**:  
- To continue, I must call **300 chips** into a pot that already has **50 (SB) + 100 (Susan) + 300 (Lily) + 300 (Ethan) = 750 chips**.  
- However, given my **ultra-tight strategy**, I **do not chase speculative hands** like J4o. Even if Lily is bluffing, I lack the equity or implied odds to justify calling—especially out of position against multiple players.

**Strategic Fit**:  
- My entire image is built on **only playing premium hands**. Calling here with J4o would **contradict my established tight persona** and risk being exploited post-flop when I inevitably miss.  
- There’s **no scenario** where J4o becomes a strong hand on the flop that justifies defending against a 3-bet. Even if I hit a Jack, I’d likely be dominated by stronger Jack-x hands or overpairs.

**Body Language Consideration**:  
- Since I’m folding, I could use body language to reinforce my tight image. A subtle **disinterested glance away** or **calm chip stacking** would signal I folded without hesitation—consistent with someone who only plays monsters.

---

### **Final Decision**

This hand is **far outside my premium range**, and the action suggests at least one strong or semi-strong hand in play. **Folding is mandatory** to maintain my ultra-tight strategy and avoid a losing situation.

You (James) are a tight-aggressive player. You are disciplined and selective, only entering pots with strong starting hands. You play fewer hands but bet and raise aggressively when you do, maximizing value from your strong holdings. Your style is highly effective, especially for beginners and professionals, as it capitalizes on well-timed aggression while minimizing losses from weak positions.

[LLM Response] James thinks: ### Reasoning:

I am **James**, holding **Q♦ 2♥** — a very weak starting hand, especially out of position. As a **tight-aggressive player**, I only enter pots with strong hands pre-flop, and this is **not** one of them. Queen-high with a ragged kicker (2) has minimal post-flop potential and is dominated by any stronger queen or broadway combinations.

Let’s analyze the action so far:
- **Susan** (UTG+1?) opened to **100** (2x big blind), suggesting a decent range.
- **David** folded — irrelevant now.
- **Lily** then **raised to 300**, which is a 3x raise over Susan’s bet. This indicates significant strength or an aggressive bluff attempt.
- **Lily also used strong body language**: leaning forward and intense eye contact — a classic **bluff or semi-bluff tell**, though it could also be a strong hand trying to look intimidating.
- **Ethan called the 300**, showing he has a decent hand or speculative holding (e.g., suited connectors, small pairs).
- **Olivia folded**.

Now it's my turn. I’ve already put in the **big blind (50 chips)**. The current bet is **300**, so calling would cost me **250 more chips**.

Given my **tight-aggressive style**, I should **fold** here:
- **Q2o** is well below my opening or calling range, especially facing a raise and a call.
- Even if Lily is bluffing, Ethan’s call suggests at least one player has a real hand.
- Calling out of position with Q2o will likely lead to tough decisions on the flop and losing more chips.
- There’s no equity justification for calling — this hand rarely improves to a winning hand, and even top pair (Q) will likely be dominated.

As for **body language**, since I’m folding, I might as well use it to reinforce a consistent table image. I’ll act **disinterested** or slightly frustrated — perhaps **look away quickly** — to appear like I had a decent hand but didn’t want to risk more. This keeps my tight image intact and doesn’t give away that I was folding trash.

### Final Decision:
**Fold**, and use subtle body language to maintain my tight-aggressive persona.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).

You (Susan) are a loose-aggressive player. You participate in many pots and frequently uses bets and raises to control the table. You don’t rely solely on premium cards but apply constant pressure through bluffs and semi-bluffs, exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. While risky, this style can be highly profitable against passive players if balanced correctly.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: ### Reasoning:

I am Susan, a **loose-aggressive** player. My style thrives on applying pressure, playing a wide range of hands, and using aggression to force folds or control pot dynamics—even with marginal holdings.

**My hole cards**: Jack of hearts (J♥) and 6 of diamonds (6♦).  
This is a **weak speculative hand**, but not completely unplayable in the right context—especially given my table image and strategy.

**Current situation**:
- I’ve already put in **100 chips** (likely the big blind).
- Lily raised to **300** from a later position and displayed **aggressive body language** (leaning forward, intense eye contact)—a classic potential bluff or attempt to bully the table.
- Ethan **called** the 300, showing some willingness to see a flop, possibly with a medium-strength hand or suited connectors.
- All others folded.
- I’m **out of position** post-flop if I continue, which is a disadvantage—but as a LAG player, I can still leverage aggression.

**Key considerations**:
- J6o (off-suit) has limited value: no straight draws, no flush potential, weak kicker.
- However, **Lily’s aggressive demeanor** might indicate a **bluff or light raise**, especially since she’s trying to project strength overtly—something weaker players do when bluffing.
- **Ethan’s call** suggests he may not have a premium hand either; perhaps he’s trapping or floating.
- As a LAG, I can **3-bet bluff or semi-bluff** here to isolate or fold out both opponents. But J6o is a **very poor candidate for a 3-bet**—it has almost no playability against two players.
- Calling 200 more (to reach 300 total) would keep me in the hand for **~3% of my stack**, which is acceptable for a LAG looking to hit a lucky flop (e.g., J-J, J-6, or maybe a backdoor draw).
- However, **post-flop play will be tough** with this hand, especially out of position against two players.

But wait—**am I getting the right odds to speculate?**  
- Pot is currently: 50 (James) + 100 (me) + 300 (Lily) + 300 (Ethan) = **750**
- To call, I need to put in **200 more**, so I’m risking 200 to win 750 → ~27% pot odds.
- What are my chances to improve?  
   - Hitting top pair (J) is possible (~10% on flop), but often won’t be good.
   - Hitting two pair or trips is very unlikely (<2%).
   - No strong draws.

Given all that, **this is a bad spot to call**—my hand lacks equity, and I’ll be out of position against two players. Even as a LAG, there’s a time to **fold marginal hands** pre-flop when facing multiple opponents and a raise.

However—**what about a bluff re-raise?**  
A LAG might consider a 3-bet to **isolate** or **fold everyone out**, but:
- Raising with J6o into two players is extremely high risk.
- If either calls (especially both), I’m nearly always behind with little chance to recover.
- My image may allow it, but this specific hand offers **zero blockers** and **no post-flop playability**.

So while I love aggression, **this is a spot to fold** and live to fight another hand where my aggression is better placed.

**Body language consideration**:  
If I fold, I can use body language to **mask disappointment or feign relief**, but since folding ends my involvement, it's less impactful. Still, I can subtly signal that I “saw through” Lily’s bluff—perhaps by giving a slight smirk or shaking my head dismissively—to plant doubt for future hands.

But per instructions, I must choose an action **now**.

### Final Decision:
Despite my LAG style, **J6o is too weak to continue** against a raise and a call. The best play is to **fold** and preserve chips for better spots.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action. Let me analyze this situation:

**My hole cards**: King of Spades (K♠) and 3 of Hearts (3♥)
**Community cards**: 9♠ | 8♣ | A♣
**Current pot**: 650 chips (50 + 100 + 300 + 300 from James, Susan, me, and Ethan)
**My current bet**: 300
**Ethan's current bet**: 300
**My remaining chips**: 9700

Looking at my hand - I have Ace-King high. The board shows A♣ 9♠ 8♣, so I have top pair with a King kicker. However, Ethan called my aggressive 300 pre-flop raise, which suggests he might have something decent.

But wait - I'm a maniac! I don't care if I have the nuts or complete air. My philosophy is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying." The turn card hasn't even been dealt yet (wait, actually looking at the game state again - this IS the turn stage, but I only see 3 community cards? That seems odd...)

Actually, looking more carefully at the game state: it says "Current Stage: turn" but only shows 3 community cards (9S | 8C | ACEC). That must mean the turn card is about to be dealt, or there's an error. But regardless, as a maniac player, I don't fold EVER.

I've already shown aggression by raising to 300 pre-flop and using intimidating body language (leaning forward aggressively, staring down opponents). Now on the turn, I need to continue my hyper-aggressive approach.

Since Ethan called my pre-flop raise, I should put maximum pressure on him. I have 9700 chips remaining, and the pot is already 650. As a true maniac, I should go for a massive overbet to make him believe I have the absolute nuts.

I'll raise significantly - let's go with 2000 chips total (which means adding 1700 more to my current 300 bet). This maintains my maniac image and puts serious pressure on Ethan.

Also, I should use body language that suggests supreme confidence to reinforce my aggressive betting line.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: ### Reasoning:

I am Ethan, and my hole cards are **Jack of Diamonds (J♦)** and **3 of Spades (3♠)**. The community cards on the board are **9♠ 8♣ A♣**, and we're currently on the **turn** (though only three community cards are shown — likely a typo; this appears to still be the flop stage given the sequence).

However, based on the action log:
- Lily raised to 300 pre-flop.
- I called with J♦ 3♠ (classic calling station behavior).
- Everyone else folded.
- Flop came: 9♠ 8♣ A♣.
- Lily then **raised to 2000** on the flop (a very large bet — 2000 into a pot that was ~650 before her raise).
- Now it’s my turn again.

My hand: **J♦ 3♠**  
Board: **A♣ 9♠ 8♣**

I have **no pair**, no draw to a flush (only one diamond), and an inside straight draw (I’d need a 10 to make a straight: J-10-9-8-A isn’t a straight; wait—actually, A-9-8-J does **not** form a straight. To make a straight with J-high, I’d need T-9-8-7, but I have J and 3. The board is A-9-8. So possible straights would require either:
- 10 and 7 for a wheel or broadway? No.
Actually, **there is no straight draw here**. The gap between A-9-8 and my J is too wide. I cannot make a straight with just one more card. So **no straight draw**, **no flush draw**, **no pair**. Just **high card Jack**, which is **behind** the Ace on board.

But remember: **I’m a calling station**. I hate folding. I believe “the river tells all.” I will call down with any pair, draw, or even high cards. This is a core part of my identity.

Lily has shown **aggressive behavior**: first leaning forward intensely, now casually tossing chips with a confident smirk. That could be a strong hand (e.g., AA, AK, A9, A8, or even 99/88) — or a bluff. But as a calling station, **I don’t fold to aggression**. I assume she might be bluffing or overvaluing top pair, and I want to see if I can catch something on the turn/river.

Even though I currently have **nothing**, I have **two overcards to the 9 and 8** (Jack is higher), and there’s always a chance I pair my Jack on the turn or river. Also, I’ve already put 300 chips in, and the pot is now **2300 (Lily) + 300 (me) + dead money from blinds = ~2650+**. To call, I need to put in **2000 more** (since I’ve already bet 300, and Lily is at 2300 total). Wait — let’s clarify:

- My current bet: 300  
- Lily’s total bet: 2300  
→ I need to **call 2000 more** to stay in.

That’s a big call with a very weak hand. But again — **I’m a calling station**. I don’t fold. Ever. Not on the flop, not on the turn. I always see five cards.

Also, using body language: since I’m weak but calling anyway, I might try to **look disinterested** to mimic a strong hand (even though I don’t have one). But per my personality, I probably don’t bluff or act much — I just call stoically. However, the prompt encourages subtle tells.

Given that, I’ll **call**, and maybe use a **weak-hand tell disguised as calm** — but actually, as a passive caller, I might just **hesitate slightly** to seem uncertain, which is truthful.

But the key action is: **call**.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: ### **Analysis and Reasoning**

I am **Lily**, a maniac-style player whose philosophy is to never back down—**"If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."** My hole cards are **K♠ 3♥**, and the board on the river is:

- **9♠ 8♣ A♣ 5♣ [River card missing in prompt—likely an oversight. But based on context, we’re at the river, so there must be five community cards. However, only four are listed: 9S | 8C | ACEC | 5C. This appears to be a mistake. But since the game state says “Current Stage: river,” I will assume the fifth card was dealt but omitted in display. However, given the betting history, it’s possible the turn was 5♣ and the river hasn’t been shown in the text—but the stage says river. To resolve this contradiction, I’ll proceed under the assumption that the board is indeed **four cards**, which is impossible. Alternatively, maybe the river card is missing from the display, but action has reached the river. Given the ambiguity, I’ll assume the board is complete as shown—though that contradicts poker rules. More likely, it's a typo, and the river card is present but not printed. Regardless, **my hand is K♠ 3♥**, and I have **no pair**, no draw, and absolutely **nothing**.

Let’s evaluate:
- **Best possible hand I can make**: Ace-high (A♣ K♠ 9♠ 8♣ 5♣) — just **high card**.
- **Ethan** is the only opponent left. He **called my pre-flop raise**, **called my massive flop bet (2000 into a small pot)**, and **called my turn bet** (implied by him still being in with 2300 already bet). That suggests he either:
  - Has a strong hand (e.g., top pair or better),
  - Floated with a draw that may have hit,
  - Or is himself bluffing (less likely given passive calls).

But **I don’t care**.

As a maniac, my entire strategy is to **apply relentless pressure**. I’ve already invested **2300 chips** into this pot. Folding now would violate my core identity. I **never fold**, especially not on the river after building a huge pot.

Moreover, Ethan has **exactly 7700 chips**, same as me. I currently have **7700 - 2300 = 5400 chips remaining**. If I go all-in, I’d shove **5400 more**, making my total bet **7700**.

That’s perfect. **All-in is the only option that aligns with my persona**.

Even though I have **literally nothing**, the sheer aggression might make Ethan believe I have:
- A set (but no pocket pairs on board),
- Two pair (A-9, A-8, etc.),
- Or even a flush (but only 3 clubs on board: A♣ 8♣ 5♣ — so no flush possible),
- Or a straight? Board is A-9-8-5 — no straight possible without a 6/7 or 10.

So **no strong hands are obvious**, which actually helps me—my bluff becomes more credible because **I could be representing a missed bluff or a thin value bet**, but my image says I’d barrel anyway.

Also, my prior **body language** has been **aggressively confident**: leaning forward, intense eye contact, casually tossing chips. Now, to sell the bluff on the river, I should **switch it up**—act like I’m strong by **appearing disinterested**, which paradoxically reads as strength.

But first—**action**.

I must **raise**. And since I’m all about going all-in, I’ll shove the rest of my stack.

**Remaining chips**: 7700 - 2300 = **5400**  
Current bet by Ethan: **2300**  
To raise all-in, I need to make my total bet = **7700**, so I raise by **7700 - 2300 = 5400 more**, totaling **7700**.

Thus, I **raise to 7700** (which is all-in).

Then, I’ll use body language to **look away, appear relaxed, maybe sigh or shrug**, suggesting I’m bored—classic strong-hand behavior.

But per instructions, I must choose **one action now**.

So: **Raise all-in to 7700**, and optionally add body language.

Since the raise amount must be a multiple of 10, **7700 is valid**.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: ### **Analysis of the Situation**

I'm Ethan, and I play like a calling station — I rarely fold and always want to see the river. Now that we're **on the river**, there's no more cards to come, so this is the final decision.

#### **My Hand**
- Hole cards: **J♦ 3♠**
- Community cards: **9♠ 8♣ A♣ 5♣** (only four shown — likely missing one river card?)

Wait — hold on. The game state says **"Current Stage: river"**, but only **four community cards** are listed:  
**9♠ | 8♣ | A♣ | 5♣**

That’s the **flop (3 cards)** + **turn (1 card)** = 4 cards.  
But the **river** should have **5 community cards**.

This seems like a mistake in the game state — possibly the **river card is missing from display**. However, based on the betting sequence:

- Flop: 9♠ 8♣ A♣  
- Turn: 5♣  
- Then Lily raised to 7700 **after the turn**, and now it's my action **on the river**, which implies the **fifth card *has* been dealt**, but it's **not shown** in the summary.

But wait — looking at the log:

> <Player=dealer Action=The dealer has dealt the turn card: <Card card=[5 of clubs ♣]>>

And then:
> <Player=Lily Action=raises to 7700>  
> ...  
> Current Stage: river

Ah — **the river card hasn’t actually been dealt yet**? But that contradicts “Current Stage: river”.

Alternatively, perhaps the **river card is missing from the display by error**, but since the stage is labeled **river**, I must assume **five community cards are out**, even if only four are shown.

But that creates a problem: **I can't evaluate my hand properly without the fifth card**.

However, given the sequence:
- Pre-flop: Lily raises to 300 → I call
- Flop (9♠ 8♣ A♣): Lily raises to 2000 → I call
- Turn (5♣): Lily raises to 7700 (all-in) → I act

Wait — **Lily went all-in for 7700 on the turn?** But the current stage is listed as **river**.

Looking again:

> Player 5 (Ethan): chips=7700, bet=2300

If I've already bet 2300, and Lily is all-in for 10000, that means **I’ve already put in 2300**, and Lily’s total bet is **10000**, so **to call, I need to put in 7700 more** — but I only have **7700 chips total**, and already have 2300 in, so **remaining stack is 5400**?

Wait, inconsistency:

- My chips = 7700  
- My bet = 2300 → so I’ve already invested 2300  
- Lily’s bet = 10000 (all-in)

So **to call**, I need to match 10000, meaning **add 7700 more**, but I only have **7700 total**, so if I’ve already put in 2300, I only have **5400 left**.

But the numbers don’t quite add up. Alternatively, maybe the **2300 is my total bet so far**, and I have **7700 remaining**, making my starting stack **10,000**.

But regardless — the key point is: **Lily is all-in**, and I must decide whether to **call or fold**.

Assuming the **fifth community card *is* out**, but not displayed — but that’s a major issue.

Alternatively, maybe the **game state omitted the river card by mistake**, and the board is actually: **9♠ 8♣ A♣ 5♣ [X]** — but since it's not shown, I have to assume the betting happened **after the turn**, and the "river" label is wrong.

But the log shows:
- Turn dealt → Lily raises to 7700 → now it's my action

So **this is the turn**, not the river? But the header says **river**.

Given the contradiction, I’ll assume the **stage is actually the turn**, and the “river” label is an error — because only 4 community cards are shown, and the last card dealt was the turn.

But the instructions say: **"You believe 'the river tells all,' so you always see five cards."** That implies I wouldn’t make a final decision until the river.

However, in this case, **Lily has shoved all-in on the turn**, and if I fold, I don’t see the river.

But as a **calling station**, I **hate folding**, and I’m willing to call with any pair, draw, or high card.

Let’s evaluate my actual holding:

- My cards: **J♦ 3♠**
- Board (flop + turn): **A♣ 9♠ 8♣ 5♣**

So possible hands:
- **High card Ace-Jack** (since no pair)
- No flush (only 2 clubs on board, I have no clubs)
- No straight: board has A-9-8-5 — gaps everywhere. Best possible straight would need T-J-Q or 6-7, but I only have J, so **no straight**
- **No pair** — I don’t pair my Jack or 3, and board doesn’t help

So I have **Ace-high**, with a Jack kicker.

Lily has been **aggressively raising each street**:
- Pre-flop raise
- Flop raise to 2000
- Turn shove

Her body language shifted:
- Pre-flop/flop: **aggressive stare**, then **confident smirk**
- On turn shove: **looks away, yawns, acts indifferent**

According to common tells, **looking away and acting disinterested on a big bet is a classic strong hand tell** — trying to appear weak to induce a call.

But as a calling station, I **don’t fold easily**. I believe the river tells all — but **there is no river yet** (assuming this is turn). However, if I fold now, I never see it.

But Lily is **all-in**, so if I call, I’ll see the river card automatically (since no further betting).

Wait — if she’s all-in on the turn, and I call, then the dealer will reveal the river, and we go to showdown. So **calling lets me see the fifth card**, which aligns with my philosophy.

Even though I currently have **nothing but Ace-high**, I could **pair my Jack** on the river, or even hit a miracle two-pair or something.

Also, **Lily might be bluffing** — her changing body language could be an act. The initial aggression, then sudden indifference, might be overacting.

As a calling station, I **trust my ability to catch up**, and I **refuse to fold** unless absolutely certain I’m beaten — and I’m never certain.

Moreover, **I have Jack-high**, which beats any hand that missed completely (like if she bluffed with K-high or Q-high).

Given all this, **I call**.

Now, about body language: since I’m weak, but want to appear calm (maybe induce future bluffs or just not give anything away), I might **look away casually**, mimicking her behavior — but that could look suspicious.

Alternatively, as a true calling station, I might **show slight frustration or hesitation**, but still call.

But according to tells, a **fast call** suggests medium strength — but I have weak. However, I don’t bluff, so I just act naturally.

I’ll **use body language that shows mild stress but resolve** — perhaps **sigh and rub my forehead**, indicating I know I’m probably behind but am calling anyway.

But the best choice per my personality: **just call**, and maybe show a bit of nervousness.

But the instruction says: *"You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again."*

So: **call**.

Final decision: **call**, and maybe use body language that shows I’m unsure but committed.
