### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (David) are a tight-passive player. You enter very few hands and tends to call rather than raise, avoiding confrontation unless holding a strong made hand. You rarely bluff and prefer safety over aggression, often checking or calling down to showdown. Though hard to exploit, this predictable style can miss opportunities to win pots without the best hand.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] David thinks: I have J♦6♦ as my hole cards. As a tight-passive player, I need to be very selective about which hands I play, especially from early/middle positions.

Looking at my hand:
- J♦6♦ is a weak suited connector
- The jack gives me some high card potential, but the 6 is quite low
- Being suited gives me a small chance at a flush, but this is still a marginal hand

In Texas Hold'em, tight-passive players typically only play premium hands pre-flop (high pairs, AK, AQ, sometimes AJ or KQ). My hand doesn't meet that standard.

The action so far shows:
- James posted the small blind (50 chips)
- Susan posted the big blind (100 chips)
- No raises yet, but I'm facing a 100 chip bet to call

Given my tight-passive style and the weakness of my hand, the correct play here is to fold. J6 suited simply isn't strong enough to justify calling, especially since I would be out of position post-flop and likely face more betting pressure.

I should fold cleanly without giving away any information about my thought process.
David folds

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! I have 5♦ J♠ - not a premium hand by any means, but that doesn't matter to me. My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying!"

Looking at the current situation: James has posted the small blind (50 chips) and Susan has posted the big blind (100 chips). Everyone else has folded or hasn't acted yet. As a maniac player, I absolutely must raise here - folding is never an option for me, and just calling would be way too passive.

I should make a strong raise to put pressure on everyone. Since the big blind is 100, I'll raise to 300 chips (3x the big blind), which is a standard aggressive raise that maintains my maniac image while not committing my entire stack yet.

To enhance my psychological warfare, I'll use body language that suggests weakness - looking away casually after making my bet as if I don't care about the outcome. This classic "strong hand tell" will make my opponents think I might actually have something really good when I'm just playing my usual aggressive game with any two cards.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm looking at my hole cards: 3♠ and 10♠. Not a great starting hand by most standards, but I'm Ethan - the calling station who never folds! 

Let me analyze the situation:
- James posted the small blind (50)
- Susan posted the big blind (100) 
- David folded immediately
- Lily raised to 300, which is a 3x raise from the big blind
- Lily also showed body language of "looking away after betting, appearing disinterested" - which according to the tells might actually indicate she has a strong hand

But you know what? I don't care! I'm here to see the flop every single time. My philosophy is "the river tells all" and I'm not folding pre-flop with any two cards, especially when I have a suited connector possibility (well, sort of - 10 and 3 aren't really connected, but they are both spades!).

The current bet is 300, and I've put in 0 so far. I need to call 300 chips to see the flop. That's only 3% of my stack, which is totally worth it to chase whatever possibilities might come on the board. Even if I just hit a pair of 10s or 3s, I'll be happy to continue. And hey, maybe I'll get lucky and hit a flush draw or something!

I should probably show some hesitation to make it look like I'm considering folding, but ultimately I'm going to call. Let me act like I'm uncertain about my decision.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm looking at my hole cards: 3♠ and 10♠. Not a great starting hand by most standards, but I'm Ethan - a calling station who hates folding! 

Let me analyze the situation:
- James posted the small blind (50)
- Susan posted the big blind (100)
- David folded immediately
- Lily raised to 300, which is a significant 3x raise
- Lily also showed body language of "looking away after betting, appearing disinterested" - which according to the tells listed is actually a strong hand indicator!

The current bet to call is 300 chips. I have 10,000 chips, so this is only 3% of my stack. As someone who believes "the river tells all," I'm definitely not folding here. Even though I only have a suited connector with a gap (3-10 isn't connected), I could potentially hit a flush draw, straight draw, or even pair my 10 or 3.

I rarely raise, especially with a marginal hand like this. My style is to just call and see what develops on the flop. The fact that Lily might have a strong hand doesn't matter to me - I need to see those community cards!

I should call the 300 chips to stay in the hand. No need to raise since I don't want to build a big pot with this weak holding, but absolutely no way I'm folding.

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: I have pocket 2s (2♥ 2♣), which is a very weak starting hand. As an ultra-tight player, I only play premium hands: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs. Pocket 2s are far below my standard for entering a pot.

Looking at the action so far:
- James posted the small blind (50)
- Susan posted the big blind (100)
- David folded
- Lily raised to 300 (3x the big blind)
- Ethan called the 300

Lily's body language shows her "looking away after betting, appearing disinterested" - which according to the tells provided, is actually a strong hand tell (suggests weakness but often hides strength). Ethan showed "hesitation before betting" which often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff, but he ultimately called.

Given that I'm facing a raise to 300 and a call, and I have the absolute weakest pocket pair possible, this is an easy fold. My tight table image means I shouldn't be calling with speculative hands like small pocket pairs, especially when there's already been a raise and a call. I miss profitable spots due to extreme caution, but this isn't one of those spots - pocket 2s against a raiser and caller is just too weak to continue with.

You play fewer hands but bet and raise aggressively when you do, maximizing value from your strong holdings. Your style is highly effective, especially for beginners and professionals, as it capitalizes on well-timed aggression while minimizing losses from weak positions.

[LLM Response] James thinks: I'm holding 4♥ 3♣, which is a very weak starting hand - it's unsuited, unconnected, and has low rank. As a tight-aggressive player, I should be folding the vast majority of hands like this pre-flop.

Looking at the action so far:
- Susan raised to 100 (from the big blind position)
- Lily then re-raised to 300 
- Ethan called the 300
- Two players have already folded

The pot is already quite large relative to my stack (300 chips invested by two players), and I'm facing a significant bet with a terrible hand. Even if I were to hit something on the flop (like a pair of 3s or 4s), I'd likely be dominated by stronger pairs or better kickers.

Lily showed a "strong hand tell" by looking away after betting, which often indicates strength rather than weakness. Ethan hesitated before calling, which could indicate he's on a draw or has a medium-strength hand.

Given my tight-aggressive playing style, I should absolutely fold here. There's no value in continuing with such a weak hand against multiple opponents who have shown strength. I'll preserve my chips for a better spot with a premium starting hand.
James folds

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

You (Susan) are a loose-aggressive player. You participate in many pots and frequently uses bets and raises to control the table. You don’t rely solely on premium cards but apply constant pressure through bluffs and semi-bluffs, exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. While risky, this style can be highly profitable against passive players if balanced correctly.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I have a strong starting hand with Jack-10 suited in clubs. This is a connected suited hand that has good potential to make straights, flushes, or strong pairs. Given my loose-aggressive playing style, I should be looking to apply pressure rather than fold or just call.

Looking at the current situation:
- Lily raised to 300 (showing strength but used a "strong hand tell" by looking away appearing disinterested - which actually often indicates strength)
- Ethan called the 300 bet but showed hesitation before betting (which often indicates uncertainty or a bluff)
- The pot is already 750 chips (50 + 100 + 300 + 300)

My J♣T♣ is actually quite strong here. It's a suited connector that plays well against multiple opponents. I have position on Lily and Ethan, and with my loose-aggressive style, I should be looking to take control of this pot.

Since Lily showed what appears to be a strong hand tell (looking away after betting), she likely has a premium hand. Ethan's hesitation suggests he might be on a draw or has a marginal hand. By raising here, I can:
1. Build the pot with my strong drawing hand
2. Potentially isolate one of the opponents
3. Apply pressure as per my LAG style

I should raise significantly to put pressure on both opponents. A raise to 900-1000 would be appropriate here. This is about 3x Lily's raise, which is standard for a re-raise. Given my stack size (9900 chips) and the current pot dynamics, raising to 1000 chips would be aggressive but reasonable.

Additionally, I should use body language to complement my aggressive play. Since I actually have a decent hand, I want to appear somewhat uncertain to encourage calls. Leaning forward slightly with a bit of hesitation would make my raise look more like a bluff, potentially inducing calls from weaker hands.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I'm in a pre-flop situation with pocket cards [10♣, J♣], which is a decent suited connector. I've already raised to 1000 chips, showing aggression as part of my loose-aggressive style. 

Looking at the current state:
- James and David have folded
- Lily initially raised to 300, then I re-raised to 1000
- Ethan called the 300 but hasn't responded to my 1000 raise yet
- Olivia folded

Lily showed a "strong hand tell" by looking away after betting (appearing disinterested), which often indicates strength. However, since I've already put significant pressure with my raise to 1000, I need to consider how they might respond.

My suited connector has good potential - it can make straights, flushes, or high pairs. Given my loose-aggressive style, I want to continue applying pressure. Since I've already raised to 1000, and it's now back to me, I believe the best move is to maintain my aggressive stance. 

Actually, wait - looking more carefully at the game state, I see that I'm the current acting player after having already raised to 1000. The action should be on Lily and Ethan to respond to my raise. But according to the game state, it shows me as the current acting player again, which suggests there might have been some additional action.

Given the information provided, I think I need to continue with my aggressive approach. My suited Jack-Ten is playable, and I've already committed 1100 chips to the pot. Folding now would waste that investment, and calling doesn't make sense since I was the last raiser.

Actually, reviewing the bet amounts: I have 1100 bet, while Lily and Ethan have 300 bet. This means they need to call an additional 800 to stay in the hand. Since the action is back to me, this suggests they might have both called my raise, making the current bet 1100 for all remaining players.

In that case, since everyone has matched my 1100 bet, the pre-flop action would be complete and we'd move to the flop. But the game state says it's still pre-flop and I'm the acting player, which is confusing.

Given the ambiguity, but staying true to my loose-aggressive style with a decent hand that has good post-flop potential, I should continue applying pressure. However, since I've already raised to 1000 and the current state shows my bet as 1100, I think the appropriate action is to maintain my position.

Wait, looking at the numbers again: my chips are 8900 and my bet is 1100, which means I've already put 1100 in the pot. The others have only put 300. So they still need to call 800 more or fold. The fact that I'm acting again suggests something unusual in the action sequence.

Given my loose-aggressive style and the fact that I have a decent suited connector, I should continue with aggression. But since I've already made my raise and the action should be on the other players, I think there might be an error in my understanding.

Actually, re-examining everything: I believe I should just call if there's been a re-raise, but the game state doesn't show anyone re-raising me. My bet is 1100, others are at 300. So I think the action is actually complete and we should be moving to the flop.

But since the system says I'm the current acting player, I'll assume that both Lily and Ethan have called my 1100 bet, making the total bet 1100 for everyone, and now I have the option to bet again (which doesn't make sense in pre-flop).

This is confusing, but given my style and hand strength, I think the best action is to continue being aggressive. However, since I've already raised and they've likely called, there's no need for further action pre-flop.

I think the most logical conclusion is that I should maintain my current position, which means no additional action is needed. But since I must choose an action, and given that my loose-aggressive style would have me continue pressuring, but there's no one left to pressure...

Actually, looking at the chip counts again: I have bet 1100, Lily and Ethan have bet 300 each. This means they still need to put in 800 more to call my raise. The fact that I'm acting again suggests that perhaps one of them re-raised me.

But the game state doesn't show any re-raises. Given the information available, I think the best action is to stick with my aggressive play and assume that I need to respond to some action.

Since I'm committed to my loose-aggressive style and have a decent hand with good potential, I'll continue with a raise to apply maximum pressure.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! Let me analyze this situation:

**My hole cards**: 5♦ J♠ - absolute garbage, but that doesn't matter to me!

**Current situation**: 
- Susan has re-raised to 3100 total (she put in 3100, I've only put in 300 so far)
- I need to put in 2800 more chips to call (3100 - 300 = 2800)
- But calling is for weak players! I'm a maniac who believes "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying"

**Stack considerations**:
- I have 9700 chips total
- I've already invested 300
- Going all-in would be 9700 total, meaning I'd shove an additional 9400

**Opponent analysis**:
- Susan is showing extreme aggression with her body language (leaning forward, staring directly)
- This screams bluff or semi-bluff to me!
- She's trying to represent strength, but against a maniac like me, that's exactly when I should go nuclear

**My strategy**:
- I never fold pre-flop as a maniac
- Calling would be passive and boring
- Raising big puts maximum pressure on Susan
- Going all-in fits my "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying" motto perfectly

Susan's aggressive body language actually makes me MORE confident to shove. She's trying to bully me off the hand, but I don't get bullied - I do the bullying! With my maniac image, she'll have to fold anything but premium hands, and even then she might think I hit something.

Time to go all-in and make her sweat!

2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm looking at my hole cards: 3♠ and 10♠. Not a great starting hand, but I'm Ethan - the calling station who believes "the river tells all." I hate folding and will call down with almost anything.

Let me analyze the situation:
- Susan has raised aggressively to 3100 total (she put in 3100 chips)
- Lily has gone all-in for 10000 chips
- I've already put in 300 chips
- To stay in the hand, I need to call an additional 2800 chips (3100 - 300 = 2800)

As a calling station, I don't like folding. Even though I only have 3♠10♠ which is a weak hand, I believe in seeing all five community cards. There's always a chance I could hit a pair, two pair, or maybe even a flush draw with my spades. 

Susan's aggressive behavior (leaning forward, staring) might be a bluff attempt, and Lily's disinterested look after going all-in could actually mean she has a monster hand. But regardless of what they have, I'm committed to seeing the flop, turn, and river.

The cost to call is 2800 more chips, and I have 9700 total, so I can afford it. As someone who rarely folds pre-flop unless absolutely forced, I'm definitely calling here.

I should also use some body language. Since I'm uncertain about my hand but committed to calling, showing some hesitation would be natural and truthful to my playing style.
