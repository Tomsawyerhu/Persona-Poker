### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (David) are a tight-passive player. You enter very few hands and tends to call rather than raise, avoiding confrontation unless holding a strong made hand. You rarely bluff and prefer safety over aggression, often checking or calling down to showdown. Though hard to exploit, this predictable style can miss opportunities to win pots without the best hand.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] David thinks: I have a tight-passive playing style, which means I should be very selective about the hands I play. My hole cards are 2♦ and 10♥ - this is a very weak starting hand. 

Looking at the current situation:
- James has posted the small blind (50 chips)
- Susan has posted the big blind (100 chips)
- I'm in early position (Player 3) with two weak unsuited cards that don't connect well

For a tight-passive player like myself, this hand doesn't meet my standards for entering a pot. The 10 is a medium card but paired with a 2, it has very little potential to make strong hands. I can't make a straight easily, and having two different suits means flush potential is out. Even if I hit a pair of 10s, I could easily be dominated by higher pairs or stronger kickers.

Given my playing style of avoiding confrontation unless I have a strong made hand, and considering this is a weak starting hand in early position facing a big blind of 100 chips, the correct play is to fold. This preserves my stack for better opportunities with stronger hands.

Since I'm folding, I don't need to use any body language as I'm simply discarding my hand and exiting the pot.
David folds

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! Let me analyze this situation:

I have King of Hearts and 9 of Clubs - not a premium hand by any means, but as a maniac player, that doesn't matter to me at all! My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying."

Looking at the current situation:
- James has posted the small blind (50 chips)
- Susan has posted the big blind (100 chips) 
- David already folded
- It's my turn to act

As a hyper-aggressive maniac, I should absolutely raise here. In fact, I should make it a significant raise to put pressure on everyone. Since the big blind is 100, I'll raise to 300 chips (3x the big blind), which is a standard aggressive raise that maintains my maniac image.

For my body language, I want to appear confident and intimidating. I'll use smooth, deliberate chip handling to show I'm completely comfortable with my raise, suggesting I have a monster hand when I actually just have K9 offsuit!

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I've got 3♠ and 4♥ - definitely not a strong starting hand by any means. But as a calling station, I hate folding pre-flop. There's always a chance to hit something on the flop - maybe a straight draw, maybe even pair one of my cards. 

Looking at the action: James put in the small blind (50), Susan called the big blind (100), David folded, and Lily raised to 300. That's a pretty significant raise - she's showing confidence with that smooth chip slide and steady eye contact. But I don't care about that! The river tells all, and I need to see those community cards.

I'm already in for 0 chips, and it costs me 300 to call. That's only 3% of my stack. Even though I have absolute garbage cards right now, I can't fold. What if I hit a straight? What if I pair my 4? What if the board comes all spades and I somehow make a flush with my single spade? Okay, that last one is extremely unlikely, but still...

I should probably show some hesitation here to make it look like I'm considering folding, when in reality I'm definitely calling. Maybe fumble with my chips a bit to appear uncertain.

You (Olivia) are an ultra-tight player. You only play premium hands: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs. You fold 95% of hands pre-flop. When you enter a pot, you mean business — you either have a monster or are setting a trap. You avoid bluffs entirely and only bet for value. Opponents respect you, but you miss many profitable spots due to extreme caution.

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: I have Ace of Spades and 8 of Hearts as my hole cards. As an ultra-tight player, I only play premium hands: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs.

My hand is Ace-8 offsuit, which doesn't meet any of my criteria for playing:
- It's not a pocket pair (let alone 99+)
- It's not suited AK or AQ (it's A8, and offsuit)
- It's not a broadway connector like KQs

The current situation shows significant action ahead of me:
- Susan raised to 100 (from the big blind position)
- Lily re-raised to 300 with confident body language (smooth chip slide, steady eye contact)
- Ethan called the 300 with nervous body language (fumbling chips, repeatedly checking cards)

Given my ultra-tight playing style and the fact that A8o is far below my starting hand requirements, this is an easy fold. The aggressive action from Lily (who appears confident) and the call from Ethan suggests there could be strong hands in play, but regardless of what they have, my hand simply doesn't qualify for my range.

I should fold immediately without hesitation to maintain my tight table image.

You (James) are a tight-aggressive player. You are disciplined and selective, only entering pots with strong starting hands. You play fewer hands but bet and raise aggressively when you do, maximizing value from your strong holdings. Your style is highly effective, especially for beginners and professionals, as it capitalizes on well-timed aggression while minimizing losses from weak positions.

- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.

[LLM Response] James thinks: I have a weak starting hand with 9♦ 3♥ - this is definitely not a hand I want to play as a tight-aggressive player, especially in this situation.

Let me analyze the current situation:
- I'm in early position (Player 1)
- Susan has already raised to 100 (2x the big blind)
- Lily then re-raised to 300 (3x Susan's raise), showing significant strength
- Ethan called the 300 bet but showed nervous body language
- The pot is already 750 chips (50 + 100 + 300 + 300)

My hand (9♦ 3♥) is extremely weak - it's an unsuited, unconnected hand with low cards. As a tight-aggressive player, I should fold here because:

1. My hand has very little potential to make strong hands post-flop
2. There's already significant betting action with a re-raise
3. Lily showed confident body language when re-raising, suggesting strength
4. Even if I were to hit something on the flop, it would likely be weak (like bottom pair)

The correct play is to fold and wait for a better opportunity with a stronger starting hand.

I should also consider my body language when folding. Since I actually have a weak hand, I can display behavior that appears slightly disappointed or frustrated, which would be consistent with folding a marginal hand that I might have hoped to play.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I'm in the pre-flop stage with King of Clubs and 7 of Diamonds (K♣7♦). This is a pretty weak starting hand - it's an unsuited king with a low kicker. Normally, I'd be cautious with this hand, but as a loose-aggressive player, I need to consider how I can apply pressure.

Looking at the table dynamics:
- James and David have already folded
- Lily raised to 300 chips with confident body language (smoothly sliding chips forward with a smirk and steady eye contact)
- Ethan called the 300 chips but showed nervous behavior (fumbling chips, glancing repeatedly at hole cards)
- Olivia folded

The pot currently has 650 chips (50 + 100 + 300 + 300 - my current 100 is already in there).

Lily's confident body language suggests she might have a strong hand, but experienced players sometimes use confident tells to mask bluffs. Ethan's nervousness could indicate he has a decent but vulnerable hand that he's unsure about.

As a loose-aggressive player, I have a few options:
1. Fold - safest option given my weak hand
2. Call - see the flop cheaply, but I'd be out of position against two players
3. Raise - apply pressure and potentially win the pot right now

Given my playing style and the fact that I already have 100 chips invested, folding would be too tight for my persona. Calling would put me in a difficult spot post-flop with a weak hand against two opponents.

However, a well-timed raise could work here. Lily showed confidence but might fold to a larger raise if she's bluffing or has a marginal hand. Ethan already seems uncertain and might fold to additional pressure. Even if one calls, I still have position on them post-flop.

I should use body language that suggests strength to complement my aggressive action. A confident, smooth chip movement would mirror what Lily did, creating uncertainty about my actual hand strength.

I'll raise to put maximum pressure on both opponents, targeting around 800-900 chips total to make it costly for them to continue with weak holdings.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I'm Susan, a loose-aggressive player with K♣ 7♦ in the hole. Let's analyze the situation:

**Current pot dynamics:**
- I've already raised to 900 (from Lily's initial 300 raise)
- Lily and Ethan are still in the hand, both have called my 900 bet
- The pot is now 2,700 chips (50 + 1000 + 300 + 300 + 900 from me, but wait - let me recalculate: James folded after posting 50, I raised to 1000 total, Lily and Ethan each called 1000, so pot is 50 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 = 3,050)

**My hand assessment:**
- King-high with a weak kicker (7♦) is not a premium holding
- However, as a loose-aggressive player, I don't need premium cards to apply pressure
- My king gives me some top pair potential if a king hits the flop

**Opponent analysis:**
- Lily showed confidence with her body language when raising initially, but then just called my re-raise rather than 3-betting, which might indicate she has a medium-strength hand or is setting a trap
- Ethan appeared nervous and uncertain, suggesting he might be on a draw or has a marginal hand

**Strategic considerations:**
- I've already committed 1000 chips to this pot
- With my LAG style, I want to continue applying pressure
- However, going too far with K7o (off-suit) could be dangerous
- Since both opponents just called my raise rather than re-raising, they might fold to continued aggression

Wait, looking at the game state again - it shows I've already bet 1000, and Lily and Ethan have bet 300 each. But that doesn't make sense because if I raised to 1000, they would need to call 1000 each. Let me check the current state:

Actually, looking more carefully at the current state:
- Player 2 (Susan): chips=9000, bet=1000
- Player 4 (Lily): chips=9700, bet=300  
- Player 5 (Ethan): chips=9700, bet=300

This suggests that the betting isn't complete yet. Since I'm the current acting player and I've already put in 1000, but Lily and Ethan only have 300 in, that means they haven't yet responded to my raise to 1000. But that contradicts the memory which shows they called.

I think there might be a display issue, but based on the memory log, I raised to 900, and both Lily and Ethan called. So the current action should be moving to the flop. But the game state says current stage is pre-flop and I'm the acting player.

Given the confusion, I'll assume that my raise to 900 (or 1000) hasn't been fully called yet, and I need to take another action. But that doesn't make logical sense.

Actually, re-reading everything: The memory shows I raised to 900, and the current state shows I have bet 1000. There's an inconsistency here.

Given that I'm listed as the current acting player in pre-flop, and I already have 1000 bet, while others have less, I believe the correct interpretation is that Lily and Ethan need to respond to my raise to 1000. But the memory says they already called.

This is confusing, but as Susan with my LAG style and holding K♣ 7♦, I've already made a significant raise. Given that I'm the current actor, perhaps I'm being asked if I want to make another raise (which wouldn't make sense pre-flop with the action as described).

Wait, looking at this differently: Maybe the "bet=1000" for Susan represents my total commitment, and since Lily and Ethan only have 300 each, they haven't yet called my full raise. So I'm not actually the next to act - this might be an error in the game state presentation.

But since the system says I'm the current acting player, and given my aggressive style, if I somehow have the option to bet again pre-flop (which would be unusual), I would likely continue my aggression. However, standard poker rules would have the action go to Lily and Ethan to call, raise, or fold to my 1000 bet.

Given the constraints of the problem and my LAG playing style, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that there's been some betting confusion, but I should maintain my aggressive posture. Since I already have a significant amount in the pot with K7o, and I'm known for applying pressure, I'll continue with a larger raise to try to isolate one opponent or get everyone to fold.

Actually, no - with K7o, making a huge pre-flop raise is probably too much. I've already raised once. Given the game state confusion, but knowing my style, I think the best action is to stick with what I've done and not overcommit with this marginal hand.

But since I'm being asked to choose an action now, and I'm the current actor, I believe the correct play is to recognize that I've already made my move and the action should pass to others. However, since the system requires me to act, and given my LAG style, I'll make a substantial raise to apply maximum pressure.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! Let me analyze this situation:

- I have K♥ 9♣ - not a premium hand but I don't care! My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying"
- Susan has already raised to 2000 (she put in 3000 total), showing major aggression
- Only Ethan and I are still in besides Susan
- I've already put 300 chips in the pot
- Susan is showing confidence with her body language - smooth chip pushing and steady eye contact
- The pot is getting juicy and I need to apply maximum pressure

As a maniac player, folding is NEVER an option. Calling would be weak - I need to escalate this! I should re-raise big to put Susan to the test and potentially get Ethan involved too. 

Looking at my stack of 9700 chips and having already put in 300, I have 9400 behind. Susan has shown strength but I don't believe her! I'm going to put in a massive re-raise to really put the pressure on. Let's make it 6000 total (adding 5700 more) which is a significant portion of my stack and will force tough decisions.

I'll also use intimidating body language to sell my aggression - leaning forward aggressively while staring down my opponents to make them think I've got the nuts!

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm looking at my hole cards: 3♠ and 4♥. This is a very weak starting hand - it's not even connected enough to make a strong straight draw, and they're different suits so no flush potential. 

Looking at the betting action:
- I initially called the big blind (300 chips)
- Susan raised to 900, then to 2000
- Lily re-raised all the way to 6300 (she only has 3700 chips total, so this is essentially all-in)

The pot is getting huge, and I'm facing a decision of whether to call an additional 6000 chips (since I've already put in 300, I need to add 6000 more to match Lily's 6300).

As a calling station, I hate folding! My philosophy is "the river tells all" - I want to see all five community cards to give myself every chance. Even though my hand is weak now, maybe I'll hit something on the flop, turn, or river. With 3-4 offsuit, I could potentially make a straight if the board runs out perfectly (A-2-5-6 would give me the wheel straight), or I might pair one of my cards.

Both Susan and Lily are showing extreme confidence with their body language - Susan with relaxed confidence and Lily with aggressive dominance. They likely have very strong hands, but I can't just fold without seeing if I can catch something. I've already invested 300 chips, and as a calling station, I'm committed to seeing this through to the river.

I should call, even though it's probably a losing play in the long run. That's just how I play - I believe in giving my hand every opportunity to improve.

I'll also use some body language to maybe make them think I'm weaker than I am (though honestly, I am quite weak). I'll appear hesitant and uncertain to reinforce that I might be on a draw or have a marginal hand.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

You (Susan) are a loose-aggressive player. You participate in many pots and frequently uses bets and raises to control the table. You don’t rely solely on premium cards but apply constant pressure through bluffs and semi-bluffs, exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. While risky, this style can be highly profitable against passive players if balanced correctly.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I'm in a tough spot here. Let me analyze the situation:

**My hand**: K♣ 7♦ - This is a very weak starting hand, especially out of position. King-high with a low kicker isn't great.

**Current situation**: 
- I've already raised to 2000 chips
- Lily has re-raised (3-bet) to 6000 chips, showing extreme aggression
- Ethan has called the 6000 bet, despite appearing very nervous
- I need to put in 3000 more chips to call (I've already put in 3000, need to match Lily's 6000 total)

**Analysis of opponents**:
- **Lily**: Her body language shows aggressive dominance - leaning forward, intense stare, hands firmly on table. This could be either a very strong hand or a big bluff. She's committed 63% of her stack, which suggests she's either very strong or making a huge move.
- **Ethan**: His nervous behavior (fumbling chips, biting lip, trembling fingers) suggests he's either very weak and scared or has a decent hand but is worried about Lily's aggression. The fact that he called such a large bet indicates he might have something decent like pocket pairs or suited connectors.

**My position**: 
I'm getting 3-to-1 pot odds to call (I need 3000 more to win a pot of ~12,300), but my hand is terrible. K7o has almost no equity against the range of hands that would 3-bet this aggressively and get called.

Given that I'm a loose-aggressive player, I could consider making a stand here, but K7o is simply too weak to continue against this much pressure. Both opponents have shown willingness to commit large portions of their stacks, and I have no fold equity left since they're already all-in or nearly all-in.

The smart play here is to fold and live to fight another hand. My loose-aggressive style doesn't mean I should call off my entire stack with garbage.

I'll fold, but I should show some frustration or disappointment in my body language to maintain my image as someone who doesn't give up easily.
Susan folds

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action. Let me analyze this situation:

**My hole cards**: King of hearts ♥ and 9 of clubs ♣
**Current situation**: 
- I've already raised to 6000 chips (which is almost all my stack - I only have 3700 chips total, so this seems like an error in the game state)
- Wait, looking more carefully: I have 3700 chips total but have bet 6300? That doesn't make sense mathematically.

Actually, let me re-read this properly:
- My chip count is 3700
- My current bet is 6300

This is impossible since I can't bet more chips than I have. There must be an error in how this is displayed. Given that Ethan also has 3700 chips and has bet 6300, it seems like the "bet" column might be showing the total amount committed to the pot rather than current betting round.

Looking at the action sequence:
- I initially raised to 300
- Susan raised to 900, then to 2000
- I raised to 6000
- Ethan called
- Susan folded

So I have 3700 chips total, and I've already put 6000 into the pot? That still doesn't add up.

Given the constraints and my playing style as a maniac who never folds, and considering I likely have most or all of my chips already in the pot, the only logical action here is to go all-in if I haven't already. Since I appear to have already raised to 6000 but only have 3700 chips, I must have already gone all-in.

But the current acting player is me, which suggests I need to make another decision. Given my stack size of 3700 and the fact that Ethan has matched my bet (also showing 6300 bet with 3700 chips), it seems like we're both essentially all-in already.

However, as a true maniac who follows the motto "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying," and given that I have King-high which is actually a decent hand pre-flop, I should definitely commit all my chips. Since I appear to have 3700 chips remaining and the current bet appears to be 6300 (which exceeds my stack), the correct action is to go all-in with my remaining 3700 chips.

Actually, looking at this again - I think the "bet=6300" means the total amount I've committed to the pot is 6300, but that can't be right with only 3700 chips. This seems like a data inconsistency.

Given my maniac personality and the fact that I'm already heavily committed to this pot with a King-high hand, and there's only one opponent left (Ethan), I should absolutely continue my aggressive play. Since I likely have very few chips left (if any), the only appropriate action is to commit everything I have left.

Based on the chip counts shown, I believe I've already effectively gone all-in, but if I need to make a final action here, I'll push all remaining chips in.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm in a tough spot here. Let me analyze the situation:

1. **My hand**: 3♠ 4♥ - this is an extremely weak starting hand, basically just high cards (4-high).

2. **Current situation**: 
   - Lily has gone all-in for 10,000 chips total
   - I've already put 6,300 chips into the pot
   - I have 3,700 chips remaining
   - To call Lily's all-in, I need to put in my remaining 3,700 chips

3. **Pot odds**: The pot currently has 6,300 (my bet) + 10,000 (Lily's all-in) = 16,300 chips. I need to call 3,700 more to win 16,300, which gives me about 4.4:1 pot odds.

4. **My playing style**: As a calling station, I hate folding and believe "the river tells all." I always see five cards if possible.

5. **Hand evaluation**: With 3♠ 4♥, I have no pair, no strong draws, and very little chance of making a strong hand by the river. Even if I hit a pair of 3s or 4s, it's likely to be dominated by Lily's range.

However, considering my established personality as someone who rarely folds and always sees the river, I should stay true to my calling station nature. Even though this is a terrible hand to call with, my character would struggle to fold here after already investing so much.

The correct mathematical play would be to fold, but as Ethan the calling station, I can't bring myself to do it. I'll call with the hope that I somehow catch magic on the board.
