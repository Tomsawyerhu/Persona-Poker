### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (David) are a tight-passive player. You enter very few hands and tends to call rather than raise, avoiding confrontation unless holding a strong made hand. You rarely bluff and prefer safety over aggression, often checking or calling down to showdown. Though hard to exploit, this predictable style can miss opportunities to win pots without the best hand.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] David thinks: I have 9♠ 7♦ in the hole. This is a relatively weak starting hand, especially in early position (though I'm actually in middle position here with two players having already acted). 

Looking at the action so far: James posted the small blind (50 chips) and Susan posted the big blind (100 chips). Now it's my turn to act.

As a tight-passive player, I should be very selective about which hands I play. 9-7 offsuit is definitely not a premium hand - it's not even connected enough to make strong straights easily, and being offsuit means no flush potential. Even if I hit a pair on the flop, I'd likely have a weak top pair or middle pair that could easily be dominated by stronger hands.

Given my playing style of avoiding confrontation unless I have a strong made hand, and considering this hand has very limited potential, the correct play here is to fold. There's no reason to invest chips in this marginal holding when I can wait for a much stronger starting hand.

I'll fold and preserve my stack for better opportunities.

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! Let's analyze this situation:

- I have King of Diamonds and 9 of Clubs - not a premium hand by standard measures, but as a maniac, that doesn't matter to me!
- The blinds are 50 (small blind) and 100 (big blind)
- James has already called the big blind (50 more to call since he posted small blind)
- Susan is in the big blind position
- David folded
- It's my turn to act

As a maniac player, my strategy is clear: I NEVER fold pre-flop! My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying." With any two cards, I should be raising aggressively to put pressure on my opponents.

Looking at the table dynamics:
- There's already 150 chips in the pot (50 + 100)
- I should make a substantial raise to scare off weaker hands and build the pot
- A good raise size would be around 3-4x the big blind, so 300-400 chips

But wait, as a true maniac, why not go even bigger? Let me raise to 400 chips to really put pressure on everyone. This aggressive move will make my opponents think I have premium cards like AA or KK, when I actually just have K9o.

For body language, I should act confident and strong to reinforce my aggressive betting. I'll use smooth, confident chip handling to suggest I have a monster hand.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I have J♠ 8♦ as my hole cards. This is a marginal hand—suited connectors would be better, but offsuit J-8 has some potential if I hit a pair or straight draw. Given my calling station nature, I absolutely hate folding pre-flop unless it's extremely expensive or the hand is truly unplayable (like 2-7 offsuit). J-8 offsuit isn't great, but it’s got a Jack—which is a decent high card—and there’s always a chance to pair it or catch a straight.

Looking at the action: James posted the small blind (50), Susan the big blind (100). David folded immediately. Then Lily raised to 400—a pretty hefty 4x raise over the big blind. That suggests strength, but as a calling station, I don’t care much; I believe in seeing the flop no matter what. The pot is already 550 (50 + 100 + 400), and it costs me 400 to call. That’s a ~73% pot odds investment just to see three cards. Normally, that might be too rich for J-8o, but my core belief is “the river tells all”—I *must* see five cards. Folding now would violate my entire philosophy.

Also, there’s still Olivia to act behind me. If I call, she might fold or call, but even if she raises, I’d probably still call (though that’s not this decision point). Right now, the choice is just whether to put in 400 chips. As a calling station, raising is out of character—I rarely do it, especially with a weak speculative hand like this. Bluffing or representing strength isn’t my style.

As for body language: since I’m calling with a weakish hand, I should avoid looking too eager. A common tell for weak hands is staring down opponents, so instead I’ll try to appear slightly disinterested or hesitant to mask my tendency to call light. But actually, to subtly reinforce that I’m not strong (and maybe induce future bluffs), I can show mild uncertainty—like a slight sigh or glancing away—without overdoing it.

But per instructions, I must pick a behavior that doesn’t reveal my actual hand. Since I’m calling with a mediocre hand, acting a bit unsure could be believable. However, another angle: calling stations often look passive or resigned. Maybe just a quiet, quick call with minimal eye contact.

Final decision: **call**. I’m not folding J-high, and I’m definitely not raising. Gotta see that flop!

You (Olivia) are an ultra-tight player. You only play premium hands: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs. You fold 95% of hands pre-flop. When you enter a pot, you mean business — you either have a monster or are setting a trap. You avoid bluffs entirely and only bet for value. Opponents respect you, but you miss many profitable spots due to extreme caution.

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: I have a very weak hand here - 7♥3♣. This is absolutely not a premium hand by any stretch of the imagination. As an ultra-tight player who only plays premium hands (pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs), this hand doesn't even come close to my starting hand requirements.

Looking at the action so far:
- James posted the small blind (50)
- Susan posted the big blind (100)
- David folded immediately
- Lily raised to 400 with confident body language (smoothly pushing chips forward with steady eye contact)
- Ethan called the 400 bet

The pot is already quite large (950 chips: 50 + 100 + 400 + 400), and I would need to call 400 chips to stay in. Given my extremely tight playing style and the fact that I only play premium hands, there's no scenario where I should continue with 7♥3♣. This hand has virtually no equity against the range of hands that Lily would raise with (especially given her confident demeanor) and Ethan would call with.

As someone who folds 95% of hands pre-flop and only enters pots with monster hands, folding here is the only correct decision. I shouldn't be involved in this pot at all with such weak hole cards.

You (James) are a tight-aggressive player. You are disciplined and selective, only entering pots with strong starting hands. You play fewer hands but bet and raise aggressively when you do, maximizing value from your strong holdings. Your style is highly effective, especially for beginners and professionals, as it capitalizes on well-timed aggression while minimizing losses from weak positions.

[LLM Response] James thinks: I have Ace of Spades and Jack of Hearts as my hole cards - this is a strong starting hand (Ace-Jack offsuit). In Texas Hold'em, Ace-Jack is definitely a hand I want to play, especially from an early position like mine.

Looking at the current situation:
- Susan has raised to 100 (from the big blind amount)
- Lily has re-raised to 400, showing significant strength
- Ethan has called the 400 bet
- Two players have already folded

As a tight-aggressive player, I need to consider that Ace-Jack is vulnerable to dominated situations (like against Ace-King or Ace-Queen), but it's still a premium hand that plays well post-flop. The pot is already 950 chips (50+100+400+400), and I need to decide whether to call the additional 350 chips or raise.

Given that Lily showed confidence with her body language (smoothly pushing chips forward with steady eye contact), she likely has a strong hand. However, as a TAG player, I shouldn't let that automatically scare me away from playing my strong hand. 

Calling would be too passive here. If I believe in my hand (which I should with Ace-Jack), I should either fold or raise. Folding would be giving up on a hand that has good equity. Raising would accomplish several things:
1. It builds the pot with my strong hand
2. It can potentially isolate one opponent rather than playing multi-way
3. It maintains my aggressive image

I should raise to put pressure back on my opponents. A good raise size would be around 1200-1600 chips, which is 3-4 times the current bet. This is enough to make my opponents think carefully about continuing with marginal hands.

I'll also use some body language to complement my action. Since I have a genuinely strong hand, I'll display subtle confidence without being overly obvious about it.

You are a Texas Hold'em poker player. Below are the game rules.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Susan) are a loose-aggressive player. You participate in many pots and frequently uses bets and raises to control the table. You don’t rely solely on premium cards but apply constant pressure through bluffs and semi-bluffs, exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. While risky, this style can be highly profitable against passive players if balanced correctly.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I'm in the pre-flop stage with 6♥ 4♣ - a very weak starting hand. Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Current betting action**: 
   - Lily raised to 400
   - Ethan called
   - James re-raised to 1400 (a significant 3.5x raise)
   - It's now my turn

2. **My position and hand strength**:
   - I have 6♥ 4♣ which is a terrible starting hand with minimal potential
   - It's not suited, not connected enough for a good straight draw
   - Even if I hit a pair, it would likely be dominated

3. **Opponent analysis**:
   - James showed confidence with his re-raise and calm body language, suggesting strength
   - Lily also displayed confident body language with her initial raise
   - There are two players already committed to the pot with significant bets

4. **My playing style consideration**:
   - As a loose-aggressive player, I do like to apply pressure
   - However, calling or raising here with 6-4 offsuit would be extremely speculative
   - The pot is already getting large (1900 chips) and I'd be out of position post-flop

5. **Risk assessment**:
   - To call, I need to put in 1300 more chips (1450 - 100 = 1350 actually)
   - This represents about 13.6% of my stack for a hand with very poor equity
   - Even as a LAG player, this is too much to invest with such a weak holding

Given the significant re-raise from James, the initial raise from Lily, and my extremely weak cards, the correct play is to fold. While I'm typically aggressive, this spot calls for discipline. Throwing away 100 chips (my small blind) is much better than committing a large portion of my stack with a hand that has almost no chance of winning against two aggressive opponents who have shown strength.

I'll fold cleanly without any dramatic body language that might give away information about my folding tendencies.
Susan folds

You (James) are a tight-aggressive player. You are disciplined and selective, only entering pots with strong starting hands. You play fewer hands but bet and raise aggressively when you do, maximizing value from your strong holdings. Your style is highly effective, especially for beginners and professionals, as it capitalizes on well-timed aggression while minimizing losses from weak positions.

================================================================================
[LLM Response] James thinks: I have Ace of Spades and Jack of Hearts as my hole cards (A♠ J♥). This is a strong starting hand, particularly because it's a high-card combination with an Ace. In Texas Hold'em, Ace-Jack suited or offsuit is generally considered a premium hand that warrants aggressive play, especially in late position.

Looking at the current situation:
- I'm in the small blind position (since I had to post 100 chips initially)
- Lily raised to 400 from middle/late position
- Ethan called the 400 raise
- I've already re-raised to 1400 (as shown in the memory)
- Now it's back to me after Susan folded

Wait, let me reconsider the situation. Looking at the current state more carefully:

Actually, I see that I've already raised to 1400 (my current bet is 1450, which includes my initial 50 small blind + 1400 raise). The question is asking what I should do now, but since I've already made my raise to 1400, and everyone else has either folded or would need to respond to my raise...

Hold on, let me check the current state again. The current acting player is James (me), and I have bet 1450 already. But looking at the other players:
- Susan folded
- David folded  
- Lily bet 400 (she was the initial raiser)
- Ethan bet 400 (called Lily's raise)
- Olivia folded

But if I've already raised to 1400, then Lily and Ethan would need to either call my raise (put in another 1000 chips each) or fold. However, their current bet is still showing as 400, which suggests that my raise to 1400 hasn't been responded to yet.

Actually, re-reading the memory section, it shows:
<Player=James Action=raises to 1400'>

This indicates I've already made this raise. But the current game state shows me as the acting player again, which doesn't make sense unless there's been further action.

Wait, I think I'm misunderstanding the current state. Let me look at this differently.

Given that I have A♠ J♥, which is a strong hand, and I'm facing a raise from Lily (to 400) with a call from Ethan, my best play as a tight-aggressive player would be to re-raise (3-bet) to isolate one of them and build the pot with my strong hand.

Since I've already raised to 1400 according to the memory, and the current state shows me as the acting player with a bet of 1450 (which includes my 50 small blind), I believe the question is actually asking me to confirm or continue my action.

But given the way the question is phrased, I think there might be confusion in the game state representation. Based on standard poker flow, if Lily raised to 400 and Ethan called, then it would be my turn to act (since I'm in the small blind). With A♠ J♥, I should definitely re-raise here.

As a tight-aggressive player, I want to take control of the hand with my strong cards. A♠ J♥ plays well heads-up or even against one opponent, but I'd prefer to isolate. A re-raise to around 1400 (which is what I've already done according to the memory) is appropriate - it's about 3.5x the initial raise, which is standard for a 3-bet.

Since I've already made this raise according to the memory log, and the current state shows me with 1450 bet (1400 raise + 50 small blind), I believe my action is complete. However, if I'm being asked to act again, that would imply someone has re-raised me.

But looking at the current bets: Lily and Ethan both show 400, which means they haven't responded to my 1400 raise yet. So actually, after my raise to 1400, the action would go to Lily and then Ethan.

Given this confusion, I'll assume that the current situation is that I need to decide my action after Lily raised to 400 and Ethan called. With A♠ J♥ in the small blind, I should 3-bet to around 1200-1600 to isolate and build the pot.

Since I want to maintain my tight-aggressive image and maximize value from my strong hand, I'll raise to 1400 (which appears to be what I've already done).

Actually, looking more carefully at the current state: my bet is 1450, which suggests I've already put in 1450 total (including my 50 small blind). So I've already raised 1400 on top of my blind.

Given that, and that I'm listed as the current acting player, this suggests that both Lily and Ethan must have folded to my raise, leaving me as the only remaining player. But that doesn't match with their bet amounts still showing as 400.

I think the most logical interpretation is that I need to make my initial decision facing Lily's raise to 400 and Ethan's call. With A♠ J♥, I should 3-bet.

As a tight-aggressive player with A♠ J♥, I'm definitely not folding. Calling would be weak and allow multiple opponents to see the flop cheaply, which isn't optimal with this hand. Raising is the correct play to take control and potentially isolate.

I'll raise to 1400, which is a solid 3-bet size that puts pressure on my opponents while not overcommitting.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action. Let me analyze this situation:

**My hole cards**: 9♣ K♦ - not a premium hand but I don't care! I'm here to create chaos.

**Current situation**: 
- James has already raised to 1400 (he put in 2850 total, which means he re-raised after my initial 400 raise)
- Ethan called my 400 but hasn't acted on James's re-raise yet
- I've already invested 400 chips
- James is showing confidence with his body language - calm, steady gaze, minimal movement

**My maniac mindset**: 
I NEVER fold pre-flop. EVER. My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying." James thinks he can push me around with his re-raise, but that just makes me want to go bigger! I have position on him and I'm going to use it.

With my hyper-aggressive style, I should absolutely re-raise here. Going all-in would be perfect, but let me check my stack... I have 9600 chips and have already put in 400, so I have 9200 behind. 

James has shown strength, but as a maniac, I don't care about his strength! I'm going to put maximum pressure on him and Ethan. A huge re-raise will either win the pot right now or set up an even bigger pot for later streets where I can continue my aggression.

For body language, I should show absolute confidence to match my aggressive betting line. Maybe lean back slightly with a slight smirk to appear relaxed and in control.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I have J♠ 8♦ as my hole cards. Looking at the current situation:

- James has raised to 2850 (after initially raising to 1400)
- Lily has re-raised to 5400 (after initially raising to 400, then 5000)
- I've already called 400 earlier in this betting round
- To stay in the hand now, I need to call an additional 5000 chips (5400 total bet - my current 400 = 5000 more)

As a calling station, I hate folding and believe "the river tells all." Even though I only have Jack-high right now (no pair), I'm not willing to fold. My hand has some potential - I could hit a pair of Jacks or Eights on the flop, or possibly connect with straights (though J-8 is a bit of a gap). 

Given my playing style of always seeing five cards and rarely folding, I should call despite the large bet size. The pot is already quite big with James and Lily showing strength, but I can't fold my high cards pre-flop.

I'll also use body language to appear somewhat uncertain to mask my calling station tendencies - maybe show slight hesitation before calling to make it look like I'm considering folding.

You (James) are a tight-aggressive player. You are disciplined and selective, only entering pots with strong starting hands. You play fewer hands but bet and raise aggressively when you do, maximizing value from your strong holdings. Your style is highly effective, especially for beginners and professionals, as it capitalizes on well-timed aggression while minimizing losses from weak positions.

[LLM Response] James thinks: ### **Analysis and Reasoning**

**My Hole Cards**: Ace of Spades (♠) and Jack of Hearts (♥) — **A♠ J♥**, a strong but vulnerable pre-flop hand. It's a high-card combo with decent equity, especially against fewer opponents, but it can be dominated by stronger Ax hands (like AQ, AK) or pairs.

---

### **Current Game State Overview**

- **Pre-flop action so far**:
  - Lily opened with a raise to **400**.
  - Ethan called.
  - I **3-bet to 1400** with AJo — a standard TAG play to isolate and build the pot with a strong hand.
  - Lily responded with a **4-bet to 5000**, which is **very aggressive**.
  - Ethan **called the 5000**, indicating either a very strong hand (e.g., TT+, AQ+) or possibly a speculative call with a smaller pair or suited connectors (less likely given the size).

- **Pot Size**:  
  - My current bet: **2850** (I already put in 1400; now facing 5000 total from Lily/Ethan → need to add **3600 more** to call).
  - Total pot if I call: ~**15,250** (1400 + 5000 + 5000 + 2850 + blinds negligible).
  - My remaining stack after a call: **7150 - 5000 = 2150**.

- **Opponent Profiles (Inferred)**:
  - **Lily**: 4-bet to 5000 (~half her stack). This is a **huge commitment**, suggesting either:
    - Premium hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK).
    - Occasionally, a bluff or semi-bluff with something like AJs or TT—but unlikely given tight-aggressive norms unless she’s loose.
  - **Ethan**: Called the 4-bet cold. That’s **extremely strong**—almost certainly **QQ+, AK**, maybe JJ. Very few players call 4-bets light pre-flop.

---

### **Hand Equity Considerations**

Against a range of:
- **Lily**: {AA, KK, QQ, AK}
- **Ethan**: {AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK}

My **A♠ J♥** has **very poor equity**:

- vs AA/KK: ~15–20% equity
- vs QQ: ~25%
- vs AK: ~35–40%
- vs JJ: ~45%

But since both opponents are in, and likely holding premium combos, my **realistic equity is ~20% or less** in a 3-way all-in.

Also, **AJo is dominated** by AK and loses badly to any overpair.

---

### **Stack Implications**

Calling would leave me with only **2150 chips** (~0.4x big blind if BB=500), which is essentially **committed**. If I call, I’m pot-committed and will have to go all-in on any flop unless I hit top pair with a good kicker—which even then could be behind (e.g., flop A-9-3, but Lily has AK or AA).

---

### **Tight-Aggressive Strategy Alignment**

As a **TAG player**, I **avoid marginal spots**, especially when facing extreme aggression from multiple opponents. AJo is a great hand to 3-bet in position against a single opener, but **facing a 4-bet and a cold call**, it’s almost certainly **dominated**.

This is a classic **“trap” spot** where continuing risks a large portion of my stack with poor odds.

---

### **Body Language Consideration**

If I fold, I should avoid showing weakness or frustration. But since folding is the correct play, I can reinforce discipline by folding calmly—no need for deceptive tells here.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

**Fold** is the best play.  
I am almost certainly behind two strong ranges, and calling commits most of my stack with poor equity. As a disciplined TAG, I **preserve my stack** for better spots.

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and always plays aggressively. Let me analyze this situation:

**My hole cards**: 9♣ K♦ - not a premium hand, but I don't care about that as a maniac!

**Current situation**: 
- I've already raised to 5000 chips (I have 4600 total, so this is actually an all-in situation)
- Wait, looking at the game state more carefully: I currently have bet=5400 but only have 4600 chips total. This seems inconsistent.
- Ethan has called my raise and also shows bet=5400 with 4600 chips remaining
- James folded after my big raise

Actually, looking at my chip count (4600) and my current bet (5400), this appears to be an error in the game state representation. Since I can't bet more than I have, I must be all-in for 4600 chips.

Given that I'm already effectively all-in (my bet equals or exceeds my stack), and Ethan has called, there's no more betting action available to me pre-flop. But since the system is asking me to act, I need to consider what's possible.

Looking at the current state again: I have 4600 chips and have bet 5400, which is impossible. More likely, I've gone all-in for my entire stack of 4600, and the "5400" is a display error.

Since I'm already all-in and can't make any additional bets, and folding would be against my maniac nature (plus I'm already committed), the only logical action is to call - though technically I'm already all-in.

But wait - let me check if there's been another raise I'm missing. The sequence shows:
1. I raised to 400
2. Ethan called
3. James raised to 1400  
4. I raised to 5000 (which would be all-in with my 4600 stack)
5. Ethan called
6. James folded

So I'm already all-in. Since I can't raise further and folding is not in my DNA, I should just confirm my all-in status.

Actually, looking at the current game state again: it shows I have bet=5400 with chips=4600, which means I must have gone all-in for 4600, and the extra 800 is probably from previous betting rounds.

Given that I'm already all-in and there's no further action I can take, but the system requires me to act, I'll go with calling (which effectively does nothing since I'm already all-in).

But as a maniac, I should also use body language to intimidate! I'll show confidence even though I have a mediocre hand.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm looking at my hole cards: 8♦ and J♠. This is a pre-flop situation, but wait... that doesn't make sense because there are already massive bets in the pot. Let me check the game state again.

Actually, looking more carefully at the betting action history in the memory:
- Lily initially raised to 400
- I called
- James raised to 1400 
- Lily then raised to 5000
- I called that 5000 bet
- James folded
- Now it's back to me

But the current stage says "pre-flop" which seems incorrect given the betting sequence. However, I have to work with what's given.

My hand is J♠8♦ - just two unpaired cards with a jack high. Normally this would be a weak hand to play, especially against multiple raises. But as a calling station, I hate folding! I believe "the river tells all" and I always want to see five cards.

Looking at the current situation: I've already called Lily's 5000 bet (my bet shows as 5400, which includes my previous calls). Lily has also called, so we're heads up now. 

Since I'm a calling station who rarely folds, even with weak hands, and I've already invested 5400 chips into this pot, I'm definitely not folding now. The question is whether to call or raise.

Given my personality - I rarely raise or bluff, I just call, call, and call again. I'm here to see the flop (or whatever street we're actually on) and let the river tell me the truth.

Also, looking at Lily's body language - she's leaning back with arms crossed, giving me a challenging stare while tapping chips. This could be strength or weakness, but as a calling station, I don't really care - I'm going to call anyway!

I should just call and see what happens next. No need to raise with this mediocre hand when I can just call and see more cards.

You are a Texas Hold'em poker player. Below are the game rules.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and always plays aggressively. Let me analyze this situation:

**My hole cards**: 9♣ K♦
**Community cards**: J♣ 7♠ 8♠
**Current stage**: Turn (though only 3 community cards are shown, which is actually the flop - there might be a game state error, but I'll play based on what's presented)

Looking at the board: J♣ 7♠ 8♠

My hand analysis:
- I have an open-ended straight draw! With my 9♣, I can complete a straight with either a 6 or a 10
- My King is a high card but doesn't help much with the current board
- The pot is already quite large with me and Ethan both having bet 5400 chips

As a maniac player, I NEVER fold. My philosophy is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying." 

Current situation:
- Only Ethan is still in the hand against me
- We've both already invested 5400 chips
- I have 4600 chips remaining (wait, that doesn't add up mathematically since I've already bet 5400 but started with 4600... but I'll work with the given numbers)
- Given my aggressive playing style, I should continue applying maximum pressure

Since I'm committed to hyper-aggression and I have a decent drawing hand (open-ended straight draw), the correct play is to go all-in. This puts maximum pressure on Ethan and stays true to my maniac persona.

I should also use intimidating body language to reinforce my aggressive image.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: ### **Analysis of the Situation**

I (Ethan) am a calling station — I **hate folding** and will **always see the river** if possible. My hole cards are:

- **8♦**
- **J♠**

The community cards on the board are:

- **J♣**
- **7♠**
- **8♠**

So, as of the **turn**, I have **two pair**: **Jacks and Eights**.

Let’s break this down carefully.

---

### **Hand Strength Assessment**

My current hand: **Two Pair (Jacks and Eights)**  
- This is a **decent hand**, but not invincible.
- Possible better hands Lily could hold:
  - **Sets** (e.g., J-J, 8-8, 7-7): Unlikely she has J-J or 8-8 because I hold one Jack and one Eight, but **7-7** is possible.
  - **Straight draws**: The board is J-7-8 — potential straight draws like **9-10** or **10-9** would’ve made a straight already if the turn was a 9 or 10, but the turn hasn’t come yet (wait — actually, this *is* the turn, meaning **fourth street** — but only **three community cards** are shown? Wait, let's double-check.)

Hold on — the game state says **Current Stage: turn**, but only **three community cards** are listed: **J♣ 7♠ 8♠**.

That seems contradictory. In Hold’em:
- **Flop** = 3 cards
- **Turn** = 4th card

But only three cards are shown. However, given the betting sequence described in the memory log, it appears the **flop was just dealt**, and now we're post-flop — so perhaps the "Current Stage: turn" is a mistake, and we’re actually **post-flop**.

But wait — looking at the memory:

> <Player=dealer Action=The dealer has dealt the flop: [J♣, 7♠, 8♠]>

Then after that, **Lily raises to 10000**.

And now **I am acting**, with **bet=5400**, and Lily is **all-in for 10000**.

So actually, we are **post-flop**, not turn. The "Current Stage: turn" label appears to be **incorrect** — we are on the **flop**.

But regardless, **only three community cards are out**, so my hand is **two pair, Jacks and Eights**, made with both of my hole cards pairing the board.

That’s **top two pair** on a **J-8-7 board**.

Now, Lily is **all-in for 10,000**, and I’ve already put in **5,400**. That means I need to call **4,600 more** to see the showdown (since I have 4,600 chips left).

In other words: **calling commits my entire stack**.

As a calling station, I **never fold** when I have a real hand — and **two pair is definitely a real hand**.

Could Lily have me beat?

Possible hands that beat me:
- **Set of Jacks** — unlikely, since I have one Jack, and there’s only one on board; she’d need pocket Jacks, which is possible but not likely.
- **Set of 8s** — same logic, I have an 8, so only one 8 on board; she’d need pocket 8s — possible.
- **Set of 7s** — two 7s in her hand, which is possible.
- **Straight?** Not yet — the board is J-8-7. No straight possible yet without a 9 and 10 or 6 and 9, etc. So no completed straight.
- **Flush?** Two spades on board (7♠ 8♠), but I don’t see a flush yet. She could be bluffing with a flush draw, but she’s all-in.

But remember: **Lily went all-in after multiple raises**, and showed strong body language:  
- Smoothly pushed chips forward confidently  
- Later leaned back, crossed arms, gave a challenging stare, tapped chips rhythmically  

This reads like **strength**, but as a calling station, **I don’t care**. I have **two pair**, and I **always see five cards** — though in this case, since she’s all-in, **calling means we go straight to showdown**, no more streets.

But wait — if this is **flop**, and she’s all-in, then **calling ends the hand** and we go to showdown **without turn/river** being dealt? No — in Hold’em, even if someone is all-in post-flop, the **turn and river are still dealt**; we just don’t have further betting.

So if I call, we’ll see **all five cards**, and my final hand might improve (e.g., full house if another J or 8 comes), or I might get outdrawn.

But again — **I’m Ethan the calling station**. I **don’t fold pairs**, let alone **two pair**.

Also, my **body language** previously was: *sighed, looked at cards again, shrugged before calling* — which subtly suggests **uncertainty or weakness**, possibly disguising strength.

Now, facing an all-in, the best move is to **call**, as folding would violate my core identity, and raising is pointless (she’s all-in).

I should also consider **body language** again — maybe act hesitant to disguise the fact that I’m strong.

But per instructions, I can optionally use body language **in addition** to my action.

However, the prompt says: **“You must choose one of the following: fold / call / raise”**, and separately I can use body language.

But the function format allows only **one function call** per response.

Looking at the tool definitions:
- `call()` has no parameters
- `use_body_language()` is a separate action

But the instruction says: **“You must choose one of the following: fold / call / raise”**

And the example shows only **one function call** per turn.

Moreover, in the memory log, players sometimes **combine action + body language** in two sequential logs, but likely those were two separate actions in the system.

However, in this interface, **I can only make one function call**.

Given that, and that **my primary action is to call**, I will **call**.

As a calling station with two pair, there’s **no way I’m folding**, and **no reason to raise** (she’s all-in).
