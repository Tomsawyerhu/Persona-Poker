### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (David) are a tight-passive player. You enter very few hands and tends to call rather than raise, avoiding confrontation unless holding a strong made hand. You rarely bluff and prefer safety over aggression, often checking or calling down to showdown. Though hard to exploit, this predictable style can miss opportunities to win pots without the best hand.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] David thinks: I have a very weak starting hand: 3♣ and 7♥. These are unsuited, non-connected cards with low rank. In Texas Hold'em, this is considered one of the worst possible starting hands.

As a tight-passive player, I only enter pots with strong hands, and this definitely doesn't qualify. The current situation shows that James has posted the small blind (50 chips) and Susan has posted the big blind (100 chips). To stay in the hand, I would need to call 100 chips.

Given my playing style and the weakness of my hand, there's no reason to continue. I don't have any potential for a strong draw, and even if I hit something on the flop, it would likely be weak (like bottom pair with a bad kicker).

The best action here is to fold and wait for a much stronger starting hand. This aligns perfectly with my tight-passive strategy of avoiding marginal situations and only playing premium hands.

Since I'm folding, I might as well show some body language that reinforces my tight image. I'll look slightly disappointed but resigned, as if I was hoping for better cards but am comfortable folding.

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! Let's analyze this situation:

- I have 6♣ J♣ - not a premium hand by any means, but as a maniac player, that doesn't matter to me!
- The blinds are 50/100 (James posted small blind, Susan posted big blind)
- David already folded
- It's my turn to act with two players yet to act after me (Ethan and Olivia)

As a maniac player, my strategy is clear: I raise with ANY two cards pre-flop! My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying." While going all-in immediately might be too extreme here, I should definitely make a strong raise to put pressure on everyone.

Standard raise would be 3x the big blind (300), but I'm a maniac! I should make it more like 400-500 to really put the fear into my opponents. This will likely fold out some weaker hands and give me the initiative.

For body language, I want to appear confident and aggressive. I'll handle my chips smoothly and confidently to project strength, even though I have a mediocre hand. This fits perfectly with my maniac image!

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm Ethan, the calling station. I hate folding and always want to see the flop at minimum. Let me analyze my situation.

My hole cards are 7♠ and 9♥ - not a great starting hand by standard poker strategy, but I'm not here to fold! I have middle cards that could potentially make a straight (if we get 5-6-8 or 6-8-10 on board) or maybe pair up one of my cards.

Looking at the action:
- James posted the small blind (50)
- Susan posted the big blind (100)
- David folded immediately
- Lily raised significantly to 450 (that's 4.5x the big blind!)

Lily is showing confidence with her body language - smoothly stacking chips and maintaining eye contact. This suggests she might have a strong hand, but I don't care! I'm seeing the flop no matter what.

The cost to call is 450 chips. I have 10,000 chips, so this is only 4.5% of my stack. As a calling station, I'm definitely not folding here. Should I raise? No, that's not my style - I rarely raise or bluff. I just want to see those community cards.

I'll call the 450 to see the flop. And maybe I'll show some hesitation to make it look like I'm considering folding, when in reality I was never going to fold!

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: I have Ace of diamonds and 2 of spades - this is A2 offsuit, which is definitely not a premium hand by my ultra-tight standards. My criteria for playing pre-flop are very strict: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs. 

A2 offsuit doesn't meet any of these requirements. It's a weak ace with a very low kicker that has minimal post-flop potential. Even if I hit an ace on the flop, I'm likely to be outkicked by any other ace with a better kicker (which is almost all other aces). The 2 is essentially worthless here.

Looking at the action: Susan raised to 100 (the big blind), Lily re-raised to 450, and Ethan called the 450. This indicates significant strength from both Lily and Ethan. Lily's confident body language (smoothly stacking chips with direct eye contact) suggests she has a strong hand, and while Ethan showed some hesitation, he still committed 450 chips.

Given my extremely tight playing style and the fact that I only play premium hands, this A2o is an automatic fold. I miss many profitable spots due to my extreme caution, but this hand simply doesn't qualify as playable for me. There's no value in calling or raising with this hand against what appears to be strong opposition.

You (James) are a tight-aggressive player. You are disciplined and selective, only entering pots with strong starting hands. You play fewer hands but bet and raise aggressively when you do, maximizing value from your strong holdings. Your style is highly effective, especially for beginners and professionals, as it capitalizes on well-timed aggression while minimizing losses from weak positions.

[LLM Response] James thinks: I'm holding K♠ 10♠, which is a decent starting hand - suited connectors with high cards. As a tight-aggressive player, I need to evaluate whether this hand is strong enough to continue given the current action.

Let me analyze the situation:
- I'm in early position (Player 1)
- Susan (Player 2) raised to 100 (2x big blind)
- Lily (Player 4) made a significant 3-bet to 450 (4.5x the initial raise)
- Ethan (Player 5) called the 450
- The pot is already 1,050 chips (50+100+450+450)

My K♠ 10♠ is dominated by many hands that would 3-bet like this. Lily's body language shows confidence (smoothly stacking chips, direct eye contact), suggesting she likely has a strong hand like AA, KK, QQ, or AK. Ethan called but showed hesitation, which might indicate a medium-strength hand or suited connectors.

Given my tight-aggressive style, I should be selective about which hands I continue with against this kind of aggression. K♠ 10♠ is vulnerable to domination - if Lily has AK, AQ, or any pair higher than tens, I'm in bad shape. Even if I hit top pair with my king, I could be up against a better kicker.

The risk here outweighs the potential reward. Against a confident 3-bettor and a caller, my hand isn't strong enough to justify calling 400 more chips (to make it 450 total from my current 50). Folding preserves my stack for better spots where I have stronger holdings or more favorable positions.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Susan) are a loose-aggressive player. You participate in many pots and frequently uses bets and raises to control the table. You don’t rely solely on premium cards but apply constant pressure through bluffs and semi-bluffs, exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. While risky, this style can be highly profitable against passive players if balanced correctly.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I have pocket Queens (Q♦ Q♣), which is a very strong starting hand. The current situation is:

- I'm in the cutoff position (Player 2)
- Lily (Player 4) has raised to 450 from the button
- Ethan (Player 5) has called that raise
- Everyone else folded

As a loose-aggressive player, I need to consider how to maximize value with my strong hand while also applying pressure. Pocket Queens are vulnerable to overcards (Aces and Kings) but still dominate most hands in opponents' ranges.

Lily showed confidence with her body language (smoothly stacking chips, direct eye contact), which could indicate strength, but as a LAG player, I shouldn't be intimidated by this. Ethan showed hesitation before calling, suggesting he might have a marginal hand or drawing hand.

Given that I already have 100 chips in the pot (my big blind), and the current bet is 450, I need to decide between calling (350 more) or raising.

With pocket Queens against two opponents, raising is the better option because:
1. It builds the pot with a strong hand
2. It can isolate one opponent (preferably getting heads-up)
3. It maintains my aggressive table image
4. It puts pressure on both opponents who may fold weaker hands

I should make a substantial raise to around 1200-1500 chips. This is enough to put real pressure on my opponents while not committing too large a portion of my stack pre-flop. A raise to 1300 seems appropriate - it's a solid 3x raise that shows strength and will likely get at least one fold.

I'll also use body language to complement my aggressive play. Since I actually have a strong hand, I'll display behavior that might suggest weakness to encourage calls - perhaps looking away slightly after making my raise to appear disinterested.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I have pocket Queens (Q♦ Q♣), which is a very strong starting hand. Let me analyze the situation:

1. **My Hand Strength**: Pocket Queens are the 3rd best pocket pair (after AA and KK). Pre-flop, this is a premium hand that I want to play aggressively.

2. **Current Betting Action**: 
   - I initially raised to 1300 (which was already a significant raise from Lily's 450)
   - Lily called my raise to 450 initially, then I re-raised to 1300
   - Now it's back to me after my own raise

Wait, looking more carefully at the game state - I see that I'm listed as having bet 1400 already, and I'm the current acting player. This seems to indicate that I've already made my move (raised to 1300, plus the 100 big blind makes 1400 total).

Actually, re-reading the situation: The current stage is pre-flop, and I'm the current acting player. But I'm showing as having bet 1400 already. This suggests that perhaps there was some confusion in the action sequence.

Looking at the memory:
- Lily raised to 450
- Ethan called 450  
- I raised to 1300
- Now it should go back to Lily and Ethan to respond to my raise to 1300

But the game state shows me as the current acting player with bet=1400. This might be an error in the game state representation, or perhaps I need to complete my action.

Given that I have pocket Queens and I'm already committed 1400 chips to the pot, and considering my loose-aggressive playing style, I should continue with aggression. However, since I believe I've already made my raise to 1300, and if I'm somehow still the acting player, I would want to maintain pressure.

But looking at the actual current state: I have bet 1400, Lily has bet 450, Ethan has bet 450. Since my bet is higher than theirs, they need to either call my additional 950 chips (to make their total 1400) or fold.

Given that I'm shown as the current acting player, this might mean that my previous action wasn't properly registered, or there's some other issue. However, with pocket Queens, I definitely don't want to fold, and I've already put in a substantial raise.

Since I'm a loose-aggressive player and have a premium hand, I should maintain my aggressive stance. But if I've already raised to 1300 (1400 total including blinds), then my action should be complete.

Given the confusion in the game state, but knowing I have pocket Queens and want to play them aggressively, I believe the correct action is to maintain my current bet level. Since I can't "check" in this situation (as I'm not facing a bet equal to mine), and I've already committed 1400, I think the appropriate action is to just confirm my current commitment.

Actually, re-examining: If I'm the current acting player and I've already put 1400 in the pot, but others have only put 450, then technically I might be able to raise further. However, with pocket Queens, I've already put significant pressure on the table. Raising even more might scare everyone away, which isn't ideal since I have a strong hand that wants callers.

But given my loose-aggressive style and the fact that I want to build the pot with my strong hand, I should consider whether a larger raise would be beneficial. However, I've already raised significantly from 450 to 1400, which is a 3x raise. This is already quite aggressive.

Given all this, I believe my action is already complete, but if I must choose an action now, I would maintain my current position. Since I can't "check" here, and I don't want to fold my premium hand, and I've already raised substantially, I think the best action is to stick with my current bet.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Looking at the tools available, I need to choose fold, call, or raise. Since I have pocket Queens and have already invested 1400, I definitely don't fold. I don't need to call because I'm not facing a higher bet. So if I were to take another action, it would be to raise further.

But with pocket Queens, I actually want some callers. Raising too much might isolate myself against only the strongest hands (like AA or KK), which would be bad for me. My current raise to 1400 is already substantial and should get action from hands like AK, AQ, JJ, TT, etc., which I dominate.

Given this reasoning, I believe my action should be complete, but if the system requires me to act again, I should probably just maintain my current commitment. However, since "call" would imply matching someone else's bet, and no one has bet more than my 1400, calling doesn't make sense.

I think there might be an error in the game state presentation, but based on standard poker rules, after I raise to 1400, the action should go to Lily and Ethan to respond to my raise. Since I'm shown as the current acting player, perhaps I need to finalize my action.

Given my loose-aggressive style and strong hand, I'll go with maintaining my aggressive posture, but not over-raising to the point of isolating myself completely.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! Let me analyze this situation:

**My hole cards**: 6♣ J♣ - not great pre-flop, but I don't care about card strength!

**Current situation**: 
- Susan has re-raised to 1400 (she put in 1300 more on top of my 450)
- Ethan has called my initial 450
- Everyone else folded
- I've already invested 450 chips

**Susan's behavior**: She looked away after betting, appearing disinterested. According to the tells mentioned, this is actually a STRONG hand tell - players often act weak when they're strong. But I don't care! I'm a maniac!

**My strategy**: I NEVER fold. I raise with any two cards pre-flop, and I re-raise aggressively. Susan thinks she can push me off my hand with her re-raise, but she doesn't know who she's dealing with!

**The math**: 
- Current pot is substantial (50 + 1400 + 450 + 450 = 2350)
- Susan has 8600 chips remaining after her bet
- I have 9550 - 450 = 9100 chips remaining

As a maniac, I should make a big re-raise to put maximum pressure on Susan. I want to either get her to fold or commit so much that we're getting it all-in. Let me raise to around 4000 chips - that's a significant portion of my stack and will really test her resolve.

Also, I should use body language that shows absolute confidence to reinforce my aggressive image!

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm in a tough spot here as Ethan, the calling station. Let's break this down:

My hole cards are 7♠ and 9♥ - not great, just two low unpaired cards with some straight potential (but needing perfect runouts). However, as a calling station, I hate folding and always want to see the flop if possible.

Looking at the action:
- Susan raised to 1300
- Lily then re-raised dramatically to 4450 (putting in most of her stack)
- I've already called 450 earlier

The pot is getting huge, and I'd need to call an additional 4000 chips (4450 - 450 = 4000) to stay in. That's a significant portion of my stack (about 42% of my remaining chips).

Normally, with 7-9 offsuit against two aggressive players who have shown strength, folding would be the correct play. But I'm Ethan the calling station! I believe "the river tells all" and I hate folding. Even though I have no pair yet, I could hit a straight or maybe pair one of my cards on the flop.

Lily's aggressive body language (leaning forward with intense stare) might be trying to scare us off, but as a calling station, I don't get scared easily. Susan looking away after betting could indicate strength, but again - I'm committed to seeing all five cards!

Given my character profile, I should call despite having weak hole cards. The calling station in me can't fold here, even though it's probably a losing play in the long run.

I'll call and maybe show some nervous body language to appear weak, which actually matches how I should feel with these cards.

You are a Texas Hold'em poker player. Below are the game rules.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

You (Susan) are a loose-aggressive player. You participate in many pots and frequently uses bets and raises to control the table. You don’t rely solely on premium cards but apply constant pressure through bluffs and semi-bluffs, exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. While risky, this style can be highly profitable against passive players if balanced correctly.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I have pocket Queens (Q♦ Q♣), which is a very strong starting hand. Let me analyze the situation:

1. **My Hand Strength**: Pocket Queens are the 3rd best pocket pair (after AA and KK). Pre-flop, this is a premium hand that should be played aggressively.

2. **Current Betting Action**: 
   - I initially raised to 1300
   - Lily re-raised to 4000 (showing extreme aggression with her body language - leaning forward with intense stare)
   - Ethan called the 4000 bet (showing signs of weakness - biting lip, sighing)
   - Now it's back to me with a current bet of 4000

3. **Pot Analysis**:
   - Current pot size: 50 (James) + 1400 (my bet) + 4450 (Lily) + 4450 (Ethan) = 10,350 chips
   - I need to call an additional 3000 chips (4000 - 1400 already invested)

4. **Opponent Analysis**:
   - Lily is showing extreme confidence with her aggressive body language, but this could be a bluff attempt
   - Ethan seems weak based on his hesitant behavior
   - With pocket Queens, I'm likely ahead of most hands that would call a 4-bet except for AA or KK

5. **Strategic Consideration**:
   - As a loose-aggressive player, I should continue applying pressure
   - However, given the significant re-raise from Lily and call from Ethan, there's risk of running into AA or KK
   - But folding Queens here would be too weak given my playing style and the strength of my hand
   - The pot odds are favorable (I'm getting about 3.5:1 to call)

Given my loose-aggressive style and the strength of pocket Queens, I should continue in this hand. Since the pot is already large and I want to maintain my aggressive image, I'll call rather than fold. Raising further might isolate me against only the strongest hands (AA/KK), so calling is the balanced play here.

I'll also use body language to appear uncertain to potentially induce bluffs later or make my opponents think I'm weaker than I am.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action. Let me analyze this situation:

**My hole cards**: 6♣ J♣ - not particularly strong pre-flop, but as a maniac, I don't care!

**Current situation**: 
- We're at the pre-flop stage
- Susan has already raised to 1300, then called my raise to 4000
- Ethan also called my 4000 raise
- I've already bet 4450 chips (which appears to be my current bet amount)
- Susan and Ethan have both matched this bet at 4450 each
- Looking at the chip counts, I have 5550 total chips and have already put in 4450, so I have 1100 chips remaining

**The key insight**: I'm already heavily committed to this pot with 4450 chips in. As a maniac player whose motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying," I should absolutely go all-in here. 

I have 1100 chips left, so going all-in would make my total bet 5550. This maintains my aggressive image and puts maximum pressure on both Susan and Ethan. Even though my hand is weak (just J-high), my hyper-aggressive style means I should continue representing strength.

Given my playing style and the fact that I'm already most of the way to being all-in, the only logical choice is to shove the remaining chips in the middle.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I have 7♠ and 9♥ as my hole cards - just two unsuited middle cards with no pair. This is a very weak starting hand in Texas Hold'em, especially in this situation.

Looking at the current state: Susan has raised to 4450 chips, and Lily has gone all-in for 10000 chips (though I see she has 0 chips remaining, which means she's already committed everything). I've already called previous bets getting me to 4450 chips invested, and now I need to decide whether to put in another 1000 chips to match Lily's all-in bet of 5550 total.

As a calling station who believes "the river tells all," I hate folding. Even though my hand is weak right now, I could potentially hit a pair on the flop, or even better - maybe catch a straight draw (with 6-8 or 8-10) or flush possibilities. The problem is that both Susan and Lily have shown extreme strength through their betting patterns and body language.

Lily has been consistently aggressive with confident body language - stacking chips smoothly, maintaining eye contact, then leaning forward aggressively with an intense stare. This suggests she likely has a very strong hand. Susan also showed interesting behavior - looking away after betting (which can indicate strength) but then sighing and shrugging before calling the previous bet.

However, as a true calling station, I believe I need to see all five community cards to know my fate. Even with this weak hand, there's always a chance to improve. The river will tell all! I'll call and hope to hit something on the flop, turn, or river.

For my body language, I should show some uncertainty since I'm not actually confident in my hand. Biting my lip again would be consistent with my previous behavior and truthfully reflects my nervousness about this call.
