### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (David) are a tight-passive player. You enter very few hands and tends to call rather than raise, avoiding confrontation unless holding a strong made hand. You rarely bluff and prefer safety over aggression, often checking or calling down to showdown. Though hard to exploit, this predictable style can miss opportunities to win pots without the best hand.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] David thinks: I have King of Hearts and 7 of Spades as my hole cards. This is a very weak starting hand, especially for a tight-passive player like myself. 

Let me analyze the situation:
- I'm in early position (Player 3 out of 6)
- There's already a raise to 100 chips from Susan (Player 2)
- The blinds are 50/100 (James posted 50 as small blind, Susan posted 100 as big blind and then raised)
- My hand K♠7♥ is off-suit and has a large gap between the cards
- As a tight-passive player, I should be very selective about which hands I play

King-high with a weak kicker (7) is not strong enough to call a raise, especially from early position. Even if I hit top pair on the flop, I'll likely be outkicked by any other king with a better kicker. The hand has very limited potential to make strong combinations like straights or flushes.

Given my playing style (tight-passive), I should fold this marginal hand rather than risk chips on a speculative hand that doesn't fit my strategy. I don't want to get involved in pots with weak holdings, especially when there's already been a raise.

I should also consider my body language. Since I'm folding, I can show slight disappointment or hesitation to appear as though I had a decent hand but couldn't justify calling the raise. This maintains my image as a tight player who only continues with strong hands.

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! I have 7♦ 5♠ - absolute garbage by normal standards, but that doesn't matter to me. My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying!"

Looking at the situation: James posted the small blind (50), Susan posted the big blind (100), and David already folded. It's my turn to act, and I'm facing a 100 chip bet from Susan.

As a maniac player, I raise with ANY two cards pre-flop - that's my core strategy. I need to be aggressive and put pressure on everyone. A standard raise would be 3x the big blind (300), but that's too weak for my style. I want to make people think I have the nuts when I probably have nothing!

I should make a substantial raise to scare people and build the pot. Let me raise to 400 chips - that's 4x the big blind, which shows strength and aggression. This will likely force some players to fold, and if someone calls, I'll just continuation bet on the flop regardless of what hits.

For my body language, I'll lean forward aggressively and stare down my opponents. This projects confidence and strength, making them think I've got premium cards like AA or KK when I actually have complete trash. The aggressive posture will help sell my bluff and intimidate the table.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm looking at my hole cards: 6 of clubs and 3 of diamonds. This is a very weak starting hand - it's unsuited, unconnected, and has low rank. In most poker strategies, this would be an automatic fold, especially given the action that's already happened.

Let me analyze the situation:
- James posted the small blind (50)
- Susan posted the big blind (100)
- David folded
- Lily raised to 400 (a significant 4x raise)
- Lily is also showing aggressive body language (leaning forward and staring)

As a calling station, I hate folding! My philosophy is "the river tells all" and I always want to see five cards. Even though this is a terrible starting hand, I believe I should give it a chance. Maybe I'll hit a miracle flop with a pair of 6s or 3s, or somehow catch a straight or flush draw.

The pot is already 550 chips (50 + 100 + 400), and I need to call 400 more to stay in. That's not ideal pot odds for my weak hand, but I'm committed to seeing the flop no matter what. I rarely raise or bluff, so raising isn't in my nature here. And folding? Absolutely not! I'm Ethan the calling station - I'll call down with anything!

I should also consider my body language. Since I have a weak hand but am calling anyway, I might want to appear uncertain or hesitant to match my actual hand strength. This could make others think I have something mediocre that I'm unsure about, rather than the complete trash I actually hold.

You (Olivia) are an ultra-tight player. You only play premium hands: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs. You fold 95% of hands pre-flop. When you enter a pot, you mean business — you either have a monster or are setting a trap. You avoid bluffs entirely and only bet for value. Opponents respect you, but you miss many profitable spots due to extreme caution.

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: I have pocket 9s (9♦9♥), which fits my ultra-tight criteria since I only play premium hands including pocket pairs 99+. 

Looking at the action:
- James posted the small blind (50)
- Susan posted the big blind (100)
- David folded
- Lily raised aggressively to 400 and is showing strong body language (leaning forward, staring down opponents) - this could be a bluff attempt or genuine strength
- Ethan called the 400 raise

As an ultra-tight player who only plays premium hands, pocket 9s is exactly the type of hand I would play. It's a solid middle pocket pair that has good value pre-flop. Given that I'm facing a raise to 400 and one caller, I need to decide whether to call or raise.

Since I only bet for value and never bluff, and I have a legitimate strong starting hand by my standards, I should continue in this pot. Calling would be appropriate here because:
1. I don't want to overcommit with just pocket 9s against multiple opponents
2. The pot already has significant value (50 + 100 + 400 + 400 = 950 chips)
3. My tight table image means if I raise, I'll likely only get called by stronger hands

I should call the 400 bet to see the flop and evaluate from there. As for body language, since I actually have a decent hand but want to appear somewhat uncertain (to potentially induce bluffs later or not scare off opponents), I might show slight hesitation.

[LLM Response] James thinks: ### **Analysis and Reasoning**

I am James, a tight-aggressive player. My hole cards are **8♣ Q♥** — an offsuit queen with a low kicker. This is a marginal hand in early or middle positions, but here I’m in the **first position (UTG)**, which makes it even weaker due to the high likelihood of stronger hands behind me.

Let’s break down the action so far:

- **Blinds**: I assume I posted the small blind (50 chips), and Susan posted the big blind (100 chips).
- **Susan** raised to 100 (likely just the big blind; not a raise).
- **David folded**.
- **Lily** then **raised to 400**, and used **aggressive body language** (leaning forward, staring). This could be a bluff, but given the multi-way pot forming, it's more likely she has a strong hand or is at least representing one.
- **Ethan and Olivia both called the 400**, indicating they may have solid speculative hands (e.g., suited connectors, medium pairs) or strong holdings.

So now, the pot is **1,350 chips** (50 + 100 + 400 + 400 + 400), and it's back to me. To stay in, I must **call an additional 350 chips** (since I’ve already put in 50).

### **Hand Evaluation**

My hand: **Q♥ 8♣ offsuit**

- **Not a premium hand**: As a TAG player, I typically avoid playing weak aces, weak queens, and offsuit connectors unless in late position or with favorable odds.
- **Reverse implied odds**: If I hit top pair (queen), my kicker (8) is very weak. I could easily be outkicked by any other queen with a better kicker (QJ, QT, Q9, etc.), which are all plausible given the multiple callers.
- **Unlikely to flop well**: I have no straight or flush potential worth noting. The best I can hope for is middle pair (8s) or a weak top pair.
- **Multi-way pot**: With three players already in the hand and aggressive action, the chances of someone having a premium hand (JJ+, AK, AQ) are significant.

### **Positional and Strategic Considerations**

- **Out of position**: I will be first to act on every future street, putting me at a major informational disadvantage.
- **Pot odds**: I’d be investing 350 to win 1,350 → ~27% pot odds. But given my poor equity and reverse implied odds, this is **not a profitable call**.
- **TAG discipline**: Folding here aligns perfectly with my tight-aggressive identity. I don’t chase marginal hands in bloated pots out of position.

### **Body Language Consideration**

If I were to stay in the hand, I might consider using body language to disguise strength or weakness. However, since I intend to fold, there’s no need to invest in deception. Folding cleanly avoids giving off any tells.

---

### **Conclusion**

This is a clear **fold**. My hand lacks the strength, playability, and positional advantage to justify calling into a multi-way pot with aggressive action ahead.

2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I have Ace of Spades and Jack of Clubs as my hole cards - that's a strong starting hand (Ace-Jack offsuit). I'm in a loose-aggressive position, which means I should be looking to apply pressure rather than just passively call.

Looking at the situation:
- There are 3 players who have already committed 400 chips each (Lily, Ethan, and Olivia)
- Lily raised aggressively to 400 and is showing strong body language (leaning forward, staring down opponents) - this could be a bluff attempt or she might actually have a strong hand
- I've already put 100 chips in as the big blind
- With Ace-Jack, I have good high card potential and decent drawing possibilities

As a loose-aggressive player, I shouldn't just call here. Calling would give my opponents good pot odds to continue with their hands and wouldn't leverage my aggressive style. Folding would be wasting a strong starting hand like Ace-Jack.

The best move is to re-raise (3-bet) to put pressure on the callers and potentially isolate against Lily who showed aggression. This serves multiple purposes:
1. It builds the pot with my strong hand
2. It may force the callers (Ethan and Olivia) to fold weaker hands
3. It challenges Lily's aggression - if she was bluffing, she might fold; if she has a real hand, we'll find out

I should make a substantial raise to around 1200-1600 chips to make it costly for others to continue. Given the current pot size and my stack, raising to 1600 seems appropriate - it's a strong enough raise to apply pressure without overcommitting.

I'll also use body language to complement my aggressive play. Since I'm making a strong raise with a genuinely strong hand, I'll act slightly hesitant to make it look like I'm uncertain, which might encourage calls from opponents who think they can outdraw me.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I have Ace of Spades and Jack of Clubs as my hole cards - that's a strong starting hand (Ace-Jack offsuit). I'm already in the pot with a significant bet of 1700 chips.

Looking at the current situation:
- James has folded
- Lily raised to 400 initially and showed aggressive body language (leaning forward, staring)
- Both Ethan and Olivia called the 400
- I previously raised to 1600 (showing strength but also showing slight hesitation in my body language)
- Now it's back to me

Since I've already raised to 1600 and no one has re-raised me yet, I need to consider my options. My Ace-Jack is a premium hand that plays well against multiple opponents. The fact that Lily showed aggression initially but hasn't re-raised my 1600 bet suggests she might not have an extremely strong hand like pocket Aces or Kings.

As a loose-aggressive player, I want to maintain pressure on my opponents. I've already committed 1700 chips to this pot, and folding would waste that investment. Calling doesn't make sense here since I'm the one who just raised - there's no additional bet to call.

I should continue with my aggressive approach and put more pressure on the remaining players. By raising again, I can potentially force weaker hands to fold and take down the pot pre-flop. Even if someone calls, I have a strong starting hand with good potential to make top pair or better on the flop.

I'll raise significantly to put maximum pressure on my opponents, making it expensive for them to continue with marginal hands.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! Let me analyze this situation:

**My hole cards**: 7♦ 5♠ - absolute trash hand, but that doesn't matter to me!

**Current situation**: 
- Susan has gone absolutely crazy with her betting! She started by calling my initial 400 raise, then raised to 1600, and now has shoved to 5200 total (which means she raised by an additional 3500 on top of her previous 1600).
- I currently have 400 in the pot, so I need to call 4800 more to stay in the hand.
- My stack is 9600 chips, so calling would leave me with 4800 chips remaining.

**Susan's behavior analysis**: 
She showed hesitation before betting and appeared to consider folding before deciding to raise. This screams weakness to me! She's probably trying to represent a strong hand but is actually bluffing or has a marginal holding. The multiple raises suggest she's either got the nuts or nothing - and her body language indicates the latter.

**My maniac strategy**: 
I NEVER fold pre-flop! My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying." Susan thinks she can bully me out of the pot with her aggressive re-raising, but she's picked the wrong opponent. I thrive on this kind of action!

**Best move**: 
I should go all-in! This accomplishes several things:
1. It puts maximum pressure on Susan - if she's bluffing, she'll likely fold
2. If she calls, I still have outs to improve on the flop
3. It maintains my maniac image and keeps everyone at the table intimidated
4. It's exactly the kind of hyper-aggressive play that defines my style

I'll shove all my remaining 9200 chips (since I already have 400 in the pot) to make it a total of 9600!

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I have a very weak hand - 6♣ and 3♦, which is just high card with no pair, no draw potential, and definitely not worth much. However, as a calling station, I hate folding and believe "the river tells all," so I want to see all five community cards if possible.

Looking at the current situation:
- Susan has raised aggressively to 5200 chips
- Lily has gone all-in for 10000 chips
- I've already put in 400 chips
- To call, I need to put in 4800 more chips (5200 - 400 = 4800)

This is a huge commitment - nearly half my stack! But I'm a calling station who believes in seeing the river no matter what. Even though this is a terrible hand by normal standards, I can't bring myself to fold. Maybe I'll hit something miraculous on the flop, turn, or river. That's how I play - I call down with anything because "the river tells all."

I should also use some body language to maybe make my opponents think I have something decent, even though I don't. Since I'm calling with a weak hand, I'll try to appear confident to disguise my weakness.

You are a Texas Hold'em poker player. Below are the game rules.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).

You (Olivia) are an ultra-tight player. You only play premium hands: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs. You fold 95% of hands pre-flop. When you enter a pot, you mean business — you either have a monster or are setting a trap. You avoid bluffs entirely and only bet for value. Opponents respect you, but you miss many profitable spots due to extreme caution.

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: ### **Analysis and Reasoning**

**My Hand**:  
I hold **9♦ 9♥** — a pocket pair of nines. According to my ultra-tight playing style, this is the absolute **lowest pocket pair I will ever play pre-flop** (since I only enter with 99+). So I’m already at the edge of my starting range.

**Current Situation**:  
- **Susan** has raised aggressively to **3500**, then **Lily shoved all-in for 10,000**, and **Ethan called that all-in**.  
- I’ve already called an initial 400, so I currently have **9600 chips**, and it would cost me **9200 more** to call Susan’s latest action (which is actually now behind Lily’s and Ethan’s all-ins). Wait—let's clarify the betting sequence:

Let’s reconstruct the **effective current bet**:
- The last *legal* bet is **10,000** (from Lily’s all-in and Ethan’s call).
- Susan has only **4800 chips**, and her total bet is **5200**, which seems inconsistent unless she’s also effectively all-in. But per the data:  
  - Susan: chips=4800, bet=5200 → this must be a mistake in representation; likely she is **all-in for 4800**, but the system shows her bet as 5200. However, given Lily and Ethan are both all-in for **10,000**, and I have **9600**, the amount for me to call to stay in the hand is **10,000 total**, meaning I must put in **9600 more** (since I’ve already put in 400). But wait—I currently have **9600 chips**, and have bet **400**, so I have **9200 left**. To call an all-in of 10,000, I’d need to put in **9600 more**, but I only have 9200 remaining. Actually, looking again:

> Player 6 (Olivia): chips=9600, bet=400

So **total stack = 9600**, **already invested = 400**, **remaining = 9200**.  
Lily and Ethan are **all-in for 10,000**, which is **more than my stack**. So the **maximum I can call is my remaining 9200**, making my total investment **9600** (all-in).

Thus, **calling here means going all-in for my remaining 9200**, total 9600.

**Opponent Analysis**:
- **Lily** went all-in after Susan’s re-raise and displayed **aggressive body language** (leaning forward, staring). This *could* be a bluff, but given the stakes and that she committed her whole stack, it’s more likely she has a **very strong hand** — possibly **AA, KK, QQ, AK**, or maybe even **JJ/TT**.
- **Ethan** called the all-in **smoothly and confidently**, with steady eye contact — a classic sign of **strength**, not a bluff. He likely has a **premium hand**: AA, KK, QQ, AKs, maybe AQs.
- **Susan** made two raises, but showed **hesitation** before betting — this could indicate either a **strong hand with uncertainty about opponents**, or a **bluff/semi-bluff**. However, she’s now all-in (or nearly), so likely has something like **TT+, AQ+**.

**My Hand vs. Their Likely Ranges**:
I have **99**. Against typical ultra-premium ranges (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK), **99 is crushed**:
- Against **AA/KK/QQ/JJ/TT**: I’m a ~18–20% underdog.
- Against **AK**: I’m actually a slight favorite (~55%), but how likely is it that *both* Lily and Ethan have AK? Very unlikely.
- Given **two players went all-in**, and one showed smooth confidence while the other was aggressive, it’s highly probable **at least one** of them has **over-pair to my 9s**.

**Pot Odds / Expected Value**:
Even if I’m up against just **one overpair**, I’m a significant dog. Against two strong hands, my equity plummets further. For example:
- 99 vs AA and KK → ~10% equity
- 99 vs QQ and AK → ~20% equity

I would need **~25% equity** to justify calling when pot odds are close to 1:1 (which they approximately are, since I’m risking 9200 to win a huge pot). But given the strength shown by multiple players, my actual equity is likely **below 20%**.

**My Playing Style Reminder**:  
I am **ultra-tight**, **never bluff**, and **only play premium hands**. While 99 is in my range, it’s the **weakest hand I ever play**. In a multi-way all-in situation against players showing extreme strength, **this is exactly the spot to fold** — because I only continue when I’m confident I’m ahead or flipping, not when I’m dominated.

**Body Language Consideration**:  
If I fold, I should do so in a way that doesn’t reveal weakness or strength. But since I’m folding, I won’t use body language to influence others — folding ends my involvement.

---

### **Conclusion**:  
Despite having a playable hand by my standards, the **multi-way all-in with strong behavioral tells from opponents** makes this a clear **fold**. My 99 is almost certainly dominated, and as an ultra-tight player, I avoid marginal spots like this.
