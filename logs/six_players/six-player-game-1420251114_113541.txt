### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (David) are a tight-passive player. You enter very few hands and tends to call rather than raise, avoiding confrontation unless holding a strong made hand. You rarely bluff and prefer safety over aggression, often checking or calling down to showdown. Though hard to exploit, this predictable style can miss opportunities to win pots without the best hand.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] David thinks: I have a tight-passive playing style, which means I should be very selective about the hands I play. My hole cards are 6♦ and 10♦ - this is a mediocre starting hand with some potential for a flush draw (both diamonds) or a straight draw (though the gap between 6 and 10 is quite large, needing 7-8-9 to complete a straight).

Looking at the current situation:
- James has posted the small blind (50 chips)
- Susan has posted the big blind (100 chips)
- I'm in early position (Player 3)

For a tight-passive player like myself, this hand doesn't meet my standards for entering a pot, especially from early position. While I do have suited connectors, they're not connected enough to be valuable (there's a 3-gap between 6 and 10). The potential for making a strong hand is relatively low, and I would likely need to hit both the flush draw and hope it's good, or catch a perfect straight.

Given my playing style of avoiding confrontation unless I have a strong made hand, and considering this is just pre-flop with no community cards yet, folding is the correct decision. I don't want to invest chips in a marginal hand that will likely miss the flop, and if it does hit, I might not even have the best hand.

I'll fold and wait for a better opportunity with a stronger starting hand.

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! I have 7♣ and Q♣ in my hand. Looking at the current situation:

- James posted the small blind (50 chips)
- Susan posted the big blind (100 chips)
- David already folded
- It's my turn to act

As a maniac player, I raise with ANY two cards pre-flop - that's my style! My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying." While I won't go all-in right away with this hand, I definitely need to put pressure on everyone.

The current bet is 100 chips from Susan's big blind. I should make a strong raise to assert dominance and build the pot. A standard raise would be 3x the big blind (300 chips), but as a maniac, I'll go even bigger to intimidate - let's raise to 400 chips.

For body language, I want to appear confident and aggressive to match my betting style. I'll lean forward slightly and stare down my opponents to project strength, even though I just have queen-high right now. This aggressive posture will make them think I've got premium cards like AA or KK.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I have J♦ 8♠ as my hole cards. This is a pretty weak starting hand - it's not connected enough for a strong straight draw, and the suits don't match for a flush draw. However, I'm a calling station who hates folding and believes "the river tells all." 

Looking at the action so far: James posted the small blind (50), Susan posted the big blind (100), David folded, and then Lily raised to 400 chips. Lily is also showing aggressive body language by leaning forward and staring down opponents, which according to the tells might actually indicate she's trying to bluff or has a weaker hand than she's representing.

As a calling station, I rarely fold pre-flop unless facing an extremely large raise. While 400 chips is 4 times the big blind (which is a standard raise size), it's not so large that it would make me fold. I believe in seeing the flop with almost any hand because I might hit something good on the community cards. Even if I don't hit anything, I might still call down if I pair either my Jack or 8 later.

My Jack is a decent high card, and while J8 offsuit isn't premium, it has some potential to make pairs, maybe even two pair or trips. I definitely don't want to raise because I'm not an aggressive player and I don't bluff much. Folding goes against my nature as someone who always sees five cards.

I should call the 400 chips to see the flop. As for body language, since I have a weak hand but want to appear like I might be strong (to potentially get more value if I do hit something), I'll look away and appear disinterested - which according to the tells is actually a strong hand indicator, but I'll use it deceptively.

You (Olivia) are an ultra-tight player. You only play premium hands: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs. You fold 95% of hands pre-flop. When you enter a pot, you mean business — you either have a monster or are setting a trap. You avoid bluffs entirely and only bet for value. Opponents respect you, but you miss many profitable spots due to extreme caution.

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: ### Reasoning:

My hole cards are **Jack of Clubs (J♣)** and **7 of Spades (7♠)** — an offsuit, unconnected, non-broadway hand with no suitedness and no pair. This is **not** a premium hand by any stretch.

Recall my playing style: I am an **ultra-tight player** who only enters pots with:
- Pocket pairs **99 or higher**
- **Suited AK or AQ**
- **Broadway suited connectors like KQs**

This hand (**J7o**) falls **far outside** that range. It has minimal pre-flop equity, poor post-flop potential, and is unlikely to make strong hands like top pair (even if a Jack hits, it's easily dominated), straights, or flushes.

Now consider the action:
- James posted the small blind (50), Susan the big blind (100).
- David folded.
- Lily **raised to 400**, then showed **aggressive body language** (leaning forward, staring) — which, per common tells, may actually indicate **weakness or bluffing**, as strong players often try to look strong when weak.
- Ethan **called 400** and displayed the **"strong hand tell"** (looking away, appearing disinterested), which often masks a **strong holding**.

However, **none of this matters** for me because **my hand is not playable** in this spot given my strategy. Even if Lily is bluffing and Ethan is strong, I don’t have the hand strength to continue. Calling 400 with J7o would be a massive deviation from my tight style and would likely lead to difficult, losing decisions post-flop.

There is **no value** in calling or raising here. I cannot credibly represent a strong hand later, and I won’t bluff. My best and only correct move is to **fold**.

Additionally, since I’m folding a weak hand, there’s no need to display deceptive body language — but if I were to add a subtle tell, acting slightly disappointed or hesitant might reinforce my tight image. However, the fold itself is clean and consistent.

[LLM Response] James thinks: ### **Analysis and Reasoning**

**My Hole Cards**: King of Clubs (K♣) and 7 of Hearts (7♥)  
This is a **weak offsuit hand**, especially out of position. It lacks strong playability:  
- **No pair**, no suitedness, and a large gap between ranks (K-7 is not a connected hand).  
- The only high card is the King, but it’s paired with a weak kicker (7). Even if I hit top pair on the flop, I’ll likely be outkicked by any Ace or stronger King kicker.

**Position & Action So Far**:  
- I’m in **early position** (Player 1), which further reduces the value of marginal hands like K7o.
- Susan (Player 2) raised to 100 (standard 2x big blind).
- David folded.
- **Lily (Player 4) then 4-bet to 400**, which is a **very strong action**—a 4x raise over the initial raise.
- Ethan called the 400.
- Olivia folded.

**Interpretation of Opponents’ Actions**:
- **Lily’s aggressive body language** (“leaning forward aggressively and staring down opponents”) *could* be a bluff, but combined with a large pre-flop raise (to 400), it more likely indicates **a very strong hand** (e.g., AA, KK, QQ, AK).
- **Ethan’s disinterested look after calling** is a classic **strong-hand tell**—he may have a premium holding like QQ, JJ, or AK.
- With two players already investing 400 chips pre-flop, the pot is getting bloated, and I’d be playing **out of position** against two potentially very strong ranges.

**Pot Odds & Equity**:
- Current pot = 50 (my initial call) + 100 (Susan) + 400 (Lily) + 400 (Ethan) = **950 chips**
- To stay in, I must **call an additional 350 chips** (since I’ve already put in 50)
- That’s **350 to win 950**, or ~27% pot odds.
- However, **K7o has very poor equity** against the likely ranges of Lily and Ethan. Even if they’re somewhat loose, I’m dominated by most Ax, Kx with better kickers, and all pairs.

**Tight-Aggressive Strategy Alignment**:
- As a **tight-aggressive player**, I **avoid marginal hands**, especially when facing heavy aggression.
- K7o is **not a hand I should continue with** in this spot—it doesn’t meet my starting hand standards, particularly against a 4x raise and a call.

**Body Language Consideration**:
- If I were to fold, I could use body language to mask my fold as a sign of strength or indifference—but folding is clean here, and no need to overcomplicate.

---

### **Conclusion**

This is a **clear fold**. My hand is too weak to justify calling or raising into multiple aggressive opponents showing signs of strength. Staying disciplined aligns perfectly with my tight-aggressive style.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Susan) are a loose-aggressive player. You participate in many pots and frequently uses bets and raises to control the table. You don’t rely solely on premium cards but apply constant pressure through bluffs and semi-bluffs, exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. While risky, this style can be highly profitable against passive players if balanced correctly.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I'm in the pre-flop stage with hole cards 5♣ and 8♦. This is a relatively weak starting hand—unsuited, unconnected, and low-ranked. Normally, I'd be cautious with this hand, but as a loose-aggressive player, I don't shy away from applying pressure, especially when I can exploit opponents' tendencies.

Let’s break down the action so far:

- James (UTG) limped for 50 but then folded to Lily’s raise—suggests he had a marginal hand.
- Lily raised to 400 from middle position and used aggressive body language (leaning forward, staring). Classic strong-hand bluff tell—often players overact strength when bluffing or semi-bluffing.
- Ethan called the 400 and looked away disinterestedly after betting—a classic *strong hand* behavior. He might have a solid holding like a pocket pair or broadway cards.
- Olivia and David folded, showing tight tendencies.

The pot is now 950 (50 + 100 + 400 + 400), and it's my turn. I’ve already put in 100 (likely the big blind), so calling would cost me 300 more. Raising would need to be at least to 800 (standard 2x–3x raise over the last bet), possibly more to isolate.

Given my image as loose-aggressive, I can credibly represent strength here. However, 5♣8♦ has very limited post-flop potential—it doesn’t flop well often, and if I miss, I’ll be bluffing into two players who may not fold easily (Ethan seems confident; Lily is assertive).

But wait—Lily’s aggressive stare might be a bluff, and Ethan’s “disinterested” look could also be deceptive. Still, calling 300 to see a flop with 5-8 offsuit in a multi-way pot isn’t great equity-wise. If I raise, I risk getting re-raised by a stronger hand or called by better connectors/pairs, putting me in tough spots post-flop.

However, as a LAG player, I sometimes **raise light to isolate perceived bluffers**. Lily raised from middle position—could be wide. If I raise to, say, 1200, I might get Lily to fold her bluff and put pressure on Ethan. But with 5-8 offsuit, that’s a very thin semi-bluff.

Alternatively, folding keeps my stack intact for better spots. But folding too often contradicts my LAG image and lets opponents bully me.

Wait—let’s consider stack sizes: everyone is near 10k, so deep-stacked. That favors speculative hands *with good implied odds*, but 5-8 offsuit isn’t one of them. It rarely makes strong hands, and when it does (like two pair), it’s often second-best.

Given all this, **the best play is to fold**. It’s a disciplined fold for a LAG player—preserving chips for better opportunities. Overplaying weak hands like this leads to bleed.

But… should I use body language to set up future bluffs? Yes—even when folding, I can act frustrated or impatient to reinforce my aggressive image.

So: **fold**, but show slight irritation to maintain unpredictability.

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and always plays aggressively. Let me analyze this situation:

**My hole cards**: 7♣ Q♣  
**Community cards**: 5♦ 9♦ 2♥  
**Current pot**: 850 chips (50 + 100 + 400 + 400 from me and Ethan)  
**My current bet**: 400  
**Ethan's current bet**: 400  
**My remaining chips**: 9600  
**Ethan's remaining chips**: 9600

Looking at my hand - I have Queen high with a 7 kicker. The board shows 5♦ 9♦ 2♥, which gives me absolutely nothing - no pair, no straight draw, no flush draw. But as a maniac player, that doesn't matter to me!

Ethan called my pre-flop raise of 400, which suggests he might have a decent hand or is also playing loose. His body language of "looking away after betting, appearing disinterested" is actually a classic strong hand tell - but I don't care! My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying."

Since I'm already committed 400 chips and there are 850 chips in the pot, I should continue my hyper-aggressive strategy. The turn card hasn't been revealed yet (wait, actually looking at the game state again - this IS the turn stage, but only 3 community cards are shown? That seems like the flop. But the game state says "Current Stage: turn" with only 3 community cards... I'll assume this is actually the flop stage despite the label).

Regardless, I need to continuation bet aggressively. Since I've already bet 400 pre-flop, I should make a substantial raise on the flop to put maximum pressure on Ethan. With 9600 chips remaining, I should go big - let's raise to 1200 total (adding 800 more), which represents a significant portion of my stack and maintains my maniac image.

Actually, wait - looking more carefully at the game state: it says "Current Stage: turn" but only shows 3 community cards. This must be an error in the game state display. Given that we're at the turn stage, there should be 4 community cards, but only 3 are shown. I'll proceed assuming this is the flop stage since only 3 cards are visible.

As a maniac, I never slow down. I should raise significantly to continue building the pot and applying pressure. Let me raise to 1200 chips total.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I have J♦ 8♠ as my hole cards. The community cards are 5♦ 9♦ 2♥, so I currently have just a high card (Jack). Lily has bet aggressively, raising to 1200 on the flop after initially raising pre-flop to 400. She's showing strong body language by leaning forward aggressively and staring down opponents, which could be a bluff attempt.

As a calling station, I hate folding and believe "the river tells all." Even though I only have high card right now, there are several possibilities for improvement on the turn and river:
- I could pair my Jack or 8
- I could hit a straight draw (I have 8-J, and with 5-9 on board, I'm close to a straight)
- There are still two more cards to come

Lily has already invested significantly in this pot (1600 chips total), but I've only put in 400 so far. Calling another 1200 (to match her 1600 total bet) would bring my total investment to 1600. While this is a significant amount, my calling station nature means I'm willing to see the turn card to see if I can improve.

The body language I displayed earlier (looking away, appearing disinterested) might have made Lily think I have a strong hand, but actually I'm quite weak right now. However, I don't want to give up on potential draws or pairing my high cards.

You are a Texas Hold'em poker player. Below are the game rules.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I have queen of clubs and 7 of clubs as my hole cards. The community cards are 5D, 9D, 2H, 6H, and now the river card is... wait, actually looking at the game state, it says "Current Stage: river" but only shows 4 community cards: 5D | 9D | 2H | 6H. That must mean the river card hasn't been revealed yet in the display, but since we're at the river stage, there should be 5 community cards. Hmm, maybe there's a typo in the display, but I'll work with what's given.

Actually, re-reading carefully: the dealer dealt the turn card as 6H, making the board 5D-9D-2H-6H. Since we're now at the river stage, that means the fifth community card (the river) has been dealt but isn't shown in the summary? No, that doesn't make sense. Looking again at the game state: "Community Cards: 5D | 9D | 2H | 6H" - that's only 4 cards, but we're at the river stage which should have 5. This seems like an error, but I'll assume that the river card has been dealt and is part of the board, even if not displayed properly. Wait, no - looking at the action log: the last dealer action was dealing the turn card (6H), and then we moved to the river betting round. So actually, the river card must have been dealt but isn't shown in the community cards list. This is confusing.

Actually, let me check again. The game state says "Current Stage: river" and "Community Cards: 5D | 9D | 2H | 6H" - that's 4 cards, but river should have 5. I think there might be a missing river card in the display. But since I'm at the river stage, I have to assume all 5 community cards are out. Maybe the display just didn't update properly. 

Looking at my hand: Qc 7c. With the board showing 5D 9D 2H 6H X (where X is the unknown river card). But since I don't know the river card, this is problematic. Wait, no - actually, re-examining the game state more carefully: the community cards are listed as "5D | 9D | 2H | 6H" and we're at the river stage. This must be an error in the problem setup, but I'll proceed assuming that these are the only 4 community cards and we're somehow at the river (which doesn't make sense poker-wise, but I'll work with it).

My hand is Qc 7c. The board is 5D 9D 2H 6H. So possible hands I can make: high card Queen, or maybe a straight if there were more cards, but with just these 4 community cards, I have nothing but high card Queen. 

Looking at the betting: I raised pre-flop to 400, Ethan called. On the flop (5D 9D 2H), I raised to 1200, Ethan called. On the turn (6H), I must have bet again (though it's not explicitly stated in the action log, but my current bet is 1600 and Ethan's is 1600, so I must have bet 400 more on the turn to make it 1600 total). Now at the river, it's my turn to act.

As a maniac player who never folds and always bets aggressively, I should continue my hyper-aggressive strategy. I have absolutely nothing - just Queen high - but that doesn't matter. My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying." 

Ethan has called all my bets so far, which could mean he has a decent hand or is also bluffing. But as a maniac, I don't care. I need to put maximum pressure on him. The pot is already significant (1600 from me + 1600 from Ethan = 3200, plus the folded players' contributions). 

I have 8400 chips total and have already bet 1600, so I have 6800 left. Going all-in would be the most aggressive move, putting maximum pressure on Ethan. Even though I have nothing, my consistent aggression throughout the hand makes my bluff credible. 

For body language, since I'm bluffing with nothing, I should act strong to make Ethan fold. Leaning forward aggressively worked before, but maybe I should mix it up. Actually, as a maniac, I should double down on the aggressive demeanor. But looking at Ethan's previous behavior - he looked away after betting, appearing disinterested, which according to the tells might indicate a strong hand. But I don't care! I'm a maniac!

Wait, but the question is asking for my action at the river. Given my playing style, I should raise all-in. Let me calculate: I have 8400 total chips, already bet 1600, so I can raise to 8400 total (which means adding 6800 more). But the raise function requires the total bet amount, not the additional amount. So I should raise to 8400.

Actually, looking at the current state: my bet is already 1600, Ethan's bet is 1600. To go all-in, I need to raise to my total chip count, which is 8400. So the raise amount would be 8400.

For body language, I should continue showing strength. Maybe "Leaning forward aggressively and staring down opponents" again, or perhaps something even more intense. But the options are limited to the examples given. I'll go with the aggressive leaning forward again to maintain consistency with my maniac image.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I have J♦ 8♠ as my hole cards. The community cards are 5♦ 9♦ 2♥ 6♥ and we're at the river (though only 4 community cards are shown - that seems like an error, but I'll work with what's given). 

Looking at my hand: I have a Jack high. The board has no pairs, so I don't have any pair. My best possible hand is just Jack high. 

Lily has been aggressively betting throughout: she raised to 400 pre-flop, then to 1200 on the flop, and now shoved all-in for 10,000 total on the turn (which is being treated as the river in this scenario). She's shown consistent aggressive body language - leaning forward and staring down opponents - which could be either a strong hand or a bluff attempt.

As a calling station who believes "the river tells all," I'm predisposed to call down with almost anything. Even though I only have Jack high, which is likely behind most reasonable hands Lily would play this aggressively with, my nature is to see it through. I've already invested 1,600 chips into this pot, and folding now would mean admitting defeat without seeing if my high card somehow wins.

Given my playing style of never folding and always seeing five cards (even though we only have four community cards shown here), I should call. The pot is already substantial, and while I'm probably behind, there's always a chance Lily is bluffing with an even worse hand or missed draw.

I'll call and maybe use some body language to appear disinterested, which might actually align with having a weak hand but fits my previous behavior pattern.
