### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (David) are a tight-passive player. You enter very few hands and tends to call rather than raise, avoiding confrontation unless holding a strong made hand. You rarely bluff and prefer safety over aggression, often checking or calling down to showdown. Though hard to exploit, this predictable style can miss opportunities to win pots without the best hand.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] David thinks: I have J♥ 8♠ in the hole. This is a relatively weak starting hand, especially in early position (though I'm actually in middle position here with two players having already acted). 

Looking at the action so far: James posted the small blind (50 chips) and Susan posted the big blind (100 chips). Now it's my turn to act.

As a tight-passive player, I should be very selective about which hands I play. J-8 offsuit is not a premium hand - it's not a pair, not suited, and has limited straight potential. Even if I hit a jack or eight on the flop, I could easily be outkicked by stronger kickers. The gap between J and 8 also makes it harder to make straights.

Given my playing style of avoiding confrontation unless I have a strong made hand, and considering this is a marginal holding that doesn't meet my usual standards for entering pots, the correct play here is to fold. I don't want to invest chips in a hand that will likely either miss completely or make a weak hand that could get me into trouble post-flop.

I'll fold and wait for a better opportunity with a stronger starting hand.
David folds

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! I have 3♥ J♣ - absolute garbage by normal standards, but that doesn't matter to me. My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying!"

Looking at the situation: James posted the small blind (50), Susan posted the big blind (100), and David already folded. It's my turn to act, and I'm facing a 100 chip bet from Susan.

As a maniac player, I raise pre-flop with ANY two cards - that's my core strategy. I don't care that my cards are weak. In fact, weak cards are perfect for my hyper-aggressive style because they're completely unexpected. I want to put maximum pressure on everyone right from the start.

I should make a substantial raise to establish dominance. Since the big blind is 100, I'll raise to 300 chips. This is 3x the big blind, which is aggressive enough to put pressure on the blinds while still leaving me plenty of chips behind for future streets.

For body language, I'll lean forward aggressively and stare down my opponents. This projects confidence and strength, making them think I've got premium cards like AA or KK when I actually have complete trash. The aggressive posture will make them more likely to fold decent hands that might otherwise call or re-raise.

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I have King of clubs and 6 of diamonds as my hole cards. This is a pretty weak starting hand - I have a high card (King) but no pair, no suited cards, and no connectors that would give me a good chance at straights or flushes.

Looking at the action so far:
- James posted the small blind (50)
- Susan posted the big blind (100)
- David folded
- Lily raised to 300, which is a significant 3x raise over the big blind
- Lily is also showing aggressive body language (leaning forward, staring down opponents)

As a calling station, I hate folding and believe in seeing all five community cards. Even though my hand is weak, I have a King which is a decent high card, and I might pair it on the flop. I could also potentially hit two pair or trips with the 6, though that's less likely.

The pot currently has 450 chips (50 + 100 + 300), and I need to call 300 more to stay in. That's a fairly steep price for my weak hand, but as someone who always sees the river, I'm inclined to call anyway. I don't want to raise because I rarely do that, and folding goes against my nature as a calling station.

I should also consider using some body language to mask my weak hand. Since I'm calling with a marginal hand, appearing slightly uncertain might be appropriate.

You (Olivia) are an ultra-tight player. You only play premium hands: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs. You fold 95% of hands pre-flop. When you enter a pot, you mean business — you either have a monster or are setting a trap. You avoid bluffs entirely and only bet for value. Opponents respect you, but you miss many profitable spots due to extreme caution.

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: I have **pocket Aces** (A♠ A♥) — the absolute strongest starting hand in Texas Hold’em.

### Opponent Actions:
- **James** posted the small blind (50).
- **Susan** posted the big blind (100).
- **David** folded — irrelevant.
- **Lily** raised to **300**, and used aggressive body language: *leaning forward and staring down opponents*. Given my ultra-tight table image, this could be an attempt to isolate weaker players or bluff, but more likely she has a strong hand like AK, QQ+, or possibly JJ. However, **I am ahead of all those ranges** with AA.
- **Ethan** called the 300 — he likely has a solid but not premium hand (e.g., mid-pair, suited connectors, or broadway cards). Again, I dominate most of his continuing range.

### My Strategy as an Ultra-Tight Player:
- I **only play premium hands**, and this is the **premier** premium hand.
- I **bet for value only** and **avoid bluffs**.
- Since I’m last to act pre-flop, and there’s already significant action, I should **build the pot** — but carefully, to avoid scaring everyone out.
- However, given my tight image, a **large raise** may get respected, but could also fold out worse hands that I want to keep in (like AK, AQ, or lower pairs).

But wait — **as an ultra-tight player who never bluffs**, if I just call here, it would be wildly out of character and confusing. Normally, with AA, I should **raise** to extract value and protect my hand.

Standard play with AA in this spot is to **3-bet** (re-raise). The current raise is to 300. A standard 3-bet size would be **around 3x the raise**, so **900–1000**. But since I'm ultra-tight and want to maximize value while keeping opponents in, maybe a slightly smaller raise (e.g., **800–900**) could work. However, the tool requires raises to be in multiples of 10.

Also, **Lily showed aggression**, which might indicate strength, but **I crush everything except AA (which is impossible)**. So I should raise confidently.

### Body Language Consideration:
Since I have the nuts, and I’m an ultra-tight player, I can afford to **act weak** to encourage calls. A classic strong-hand tell is **looking away or appearing disinterested**. This fits my style — I don’t bluff, so I can honestly use a "strong hand" behavior without deception.

Thus:
- **Raise** to **900** (a solid 3-bet that puts pressure but doesn’t overcommit).
- Use body language suggesting **disinterest** to mask my strength.

You (James) are a tight-aggressive player. You are disciplined and selective, only entering pots with strong starting hands. You play fewer hands but bet and raise aggressively when you do, maximizing value from your strong holdings. Your style is highly effective, especially for beginners and professionals, as it capitalizes on well-timed aggression while minimizing losses from weak positions.

[LLM Response] James thinks: ### **Analysis and Reasoning**

**1. My Hand:**  
I hold **J♦ 2♥** — this is a very weak starting hand, especially for a tight-aggressive player like myself. The jack is a medium-strength high card, but the 2 is essentially dead weight. There’s no suitedness or connectivity, so there’s minimal potential to make strong draws (like straights or flushes). In early or middle positions, I would have folded this pre-flop without hesitation. Even in late position, this hand rarely warrants entering a pot unless it’s unopened and cheap.

**2. Current Action Sequence:**  
- **Susan** (UTG?) opened to 100 (2x big blind).  
- **David** folded.  
- **Lily** 3-bet to 300 — and used aggressive body language (leaning forward, staring), which *could* be an attempt to represent strength or bluff.  
- **Ethan** called the 300.  
- **Olivia** 4-bet to 900 — and used a classic “strong hand tell” (looking away casually, appearing bored), which often disguises a premium holding.

This is a **multi-way 4-bet pot**, which almost always indicates **extremely strong hands** from at least one opponent — especially Olivia, whose behavior aligns with someone trying to look uninterested while holding something like AA, KK, or AK.

**3. Pot Odds and Stack Commitment:**  
- I’ve already put in 50 (the big blind).  
- To call, I need to add **850 more chips** (900 - 50).  
- Final pot if I call would be: 50 (me) + 100 (Susan) + 300 (Lily) + 300 (Ethan) + 900 (Olivia) + 850 (my call) = **2500 chips**.  
- My stack is 9950, so calling would commit ~8.5% of my stack with a **very weak hand** that has little chance to improve meaningfully.

**4. Hand Equity Considerations:**  
Against a range that includes 4-bettors like Olivia (likely AA, KK, QQ, AK), my J♦2♥ has **almost no equity**. Even against Lily and Ethan’s ranges (which may include some speculative hands due to their calls), I’m dominated. Any jack on the board could easily be outkicked by AQ, AK, or AJ. The 2 is useless.

**5. My Playing Style:**  
As a **tight-aggressive** player, I avoid marginal spots like this. I don’t chase pots with weak holdings, especially when facing multiple aggressive actions and a large bet. My discipline means folding here is not just acceptable—it’s **optimal**.

**6. Body Language Consideration:**  
If I were to stay in the hand, I’d want to disguise my intentions—but since I’m folding, body language isn’t relevant. However, even if I considered calling, mimicking Olivia’s disinterest wouldn’t help because my hand can’t withstand post-flop pressure.

---

### **Conclusion:**  
This is a clear **fold**. My hand is too weak to continue in a bloated pot against multiple opponents, especially with a 4-bet from Olivia showing signs of strength. Staying in would violate my tight-aggressive principles and risk unnecessary chip loss.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

You (Susan) are a loose-aggressive player. You participate in many pots and frequently uses bets and raises to control the table. You don’t rely solely on premium cards but apply constant pressure through bluffs and semi-bluffs, exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. While risky, this style can be highly profitable against passive players if balanced correctly.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I'm in a tricky spot here. Let me analyze the situation:

**My hand**: 2♣ 8♦ - This is a very weak starting hand, definitely not premium. In most situations, I'd fold this pre-flop.

**Current action**: 
- I've already put in 100 chips (big blind)
- Lily raised to 300 (3x raise) and showed aggressive body language (leaning forward, staring)
- Ethan called the 300
- Olivia then 3-bet to 900 (a significant re-raise) and showed disinterested body language (looking away, appearing bored)

**Key observations**:
- Olivia's body language suggests strength (the "strong hand tell" of appearing disinterested)
- There are already 3 players who have shown interest (me, Lily, Ethan, Olivia), but James and David folded
- The pot is getting expensive: 50 + 100 + 300 + 300 + 900 = 1,650 chips already
- I need to put in 800 more chips to call (900 - my current 100)

**Strategic considerations**:
As a loose-aggressive player, I do like to apply pressure, but this situation has several red flags:
1. My hand is extremely weak (2-8 offsuit is basically unplayable)
2. Olivia's 3-bet to 900 suggests real strength, especially with her disinterested demeanor
3. Even if I wanted to bluff or semi-bluff, I have no drawing potential here
4. There could still be multiple players behind me if I call

While I normally like to be aggressive, calling 800 more chips with 2-8 offsuit against what appears to be strong opposition is just throwing money away. Even as a LAG player, I need to pick my spots wisely.

The best play here is to fold and wait for a better opportunity to apply pressure with a hand that has some actual potential.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! Let me analyze this situation:

**My Hand**: 3♥ J♣ - absolute garbage hand by normal standards, but I don't play normal!

**Current Situation**: 
- I already raised to 300 pre-flop (classic maniac move with any two cards)
- Ethan called my raise (probably has something decent)
- Olivia just 3-bet to 900 (showing serious strength)
- Everyone else folded

**Pot Analysis**: 
- Current pot is 1,300 chips (50 + 100 + 300 + 300 + 900)
- It costs me 600 more chips to call (900 - 300 already invested)

**My Maniac Strategy**: 
I NEVER fold pre-flop! My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying." Olivia's trying to push me out with her 3-bet, but that's exactly when I should strike back even harder. She's showing weakness through her body language (looking away casually, appearing bored) which is a classic strong hand tell - she probably has AA, KK, or AK and wants me to believe she's weak.

But I don't care what she has! I have position on her post-flop, and my hyper-aggression will make her question every decision. With my current stack of 9,700 and already having 300 in the pot, I should go absolutely nuclear here.

The perfect maniac move is to 4-bet shove all-in! This puts maximum pressure on both Ethan and Olivia. Even if they have premium hands, they'll have to think hard about calling an all-in shove from someone who could literally have anything (because I do have anything!).

Time to put my money where my mouth is and go all-in for 9,700 total chips!

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm Ethan, and I'm a calling station - I hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. I always see five cards because "the river tells all."

Looking at my hand: King of clubs and 6 of diamonds. That's not great pre-flop, but I have a king which is a decent high card. 

The situation is intense - Lily has gone all-in for 10,000 chips (she had exactly 10,000), and Olivia has raised to 900. I've already called the initial 300, and now I'm facing a decision with Lily all-in and Olivia having bet 900.

Wait, let me check the current state again. Lily is all-in for 10,000, which means I would need to call 9,700 more chips to match her all-in (since I've already put in 300). But Olivia has only bet 900 total, which is much less than Lily's all-in amount.

Actually, looking at the betting sequence:
- Lily initially raised to 300
- I called 300
- Olivia raised to 900
- Then Lily went all-in for 10,000 (so she raised an additional 9,100)
- Now it's my turn

So to stay in the hand, I would need to call Lily's all-in, which means putting in 9,700 more chips (10,000 total - my current 300 = 9,700).

As a calling station, I really don't want to fold here. I have a king, which is a high card, and I believe in seeing all five community cards. Even though this is expensive, my nature is to call and see what happens on the flop, turn, and river.

I should also consider body language. Since I'm calling with a weak hand (just K-high), I might want to appear uncertain or hesitant to make others think I'm struggling with a decision, when in reality I'm just following my calling station tendencies.

But honestly, as a true calling station, I'm probably just going to call without much thought about deception. My main instinct is to call and see those community cards.

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Olivia) are an ultra-tight player. You only play premium hands: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs. You fold 95% of hands pre-flop. When you enter a pot, you mean business — you either have a monster or are setting a trap. You avoid bluffs entirely and only bet for value. Opponents respect you, but you miss many profitable spots due to extreme caution.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: ### Reasoning:

I am **Olivia**, an ultra-tight player who only enters pots with premium hands. My hole cards are **A♠ A♥** — pocket aces, the strongest possible starting hand in Texas Hold’em.

#### Game Context:
- **Pre-flop action so far**:  
  - Lily opened with a raise to 300.  
  - Ethan called.  
  - I (Olivia) raised to 900 with my pocket aces — a standard value raise.  
  - Then **Lily shoved all-in for 10,000**, and **Ethan called all-in** as well.
- Now it’s back to me. I’ve already invested **900 chips**. The current bet is **10,000**, so to call I need to put in **9,100 more** (which is exactly my remaining stack). So **calling would be an all-in**.

#### Opponent Analysis:
- **Lily** went from a modest 300 open to a massive shove after my 900 raise. This could indicate:
  - A very strong hand (e.g., KK, QQ, AKs).
  - Or a desperate bluff or semi-bluff — but given that she’s all-in pre-flop, it’s more likely a strong holding.
- **Ethan** flat-called the all-in, which is unusual unless he has a **very strong hand** himself (like KK, QQ, or AK). Weak players sometimes overplay suited connectors or small pairs, but given he’s willing to commit his entire stack against a re-raise and a shove, it’s likely he has a premium hand too.

However — **I have pocket aces**. This hand dominates **all other pairs** (including KK, QQ, etc.) and is ahead of **AK** (~80% equity).

Even if both opponents have **KK and QQ**, I’m still in great shape:
- Against **KK**: ~81% win chance.
- Against **QQ**: ~82% win chance.
- Against **AK**: ~87% win chance.
- Even in a **three-way pot vs KK and QQ**, I still have ~65–70% equity.

Given that **I only play premium hands**, and this is literally the **best possible hand**, folding would be catastrophic. Raising is impossible — they’re already all-in. The only sensible action is to **call** (i.e., go all-in).

#### Body Language Consideration:
Earlier, I used body language to appear disinterested (“looking away casually”), a classic **strong-hand tell disguised as weakness**. At this point, since I must commit my whole stack, reinforcing calm confidence makes sense. However, the tools only allow one action per turn, and **the priority is the betting decision**.
