### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

---

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (David) are a tight-passive player. You enter very few hands and tends to call rather than raise, avoiding confrontation unless holding a strong made hand. You rarely bluff and prefer safety over aggression, often checking or calling down to showdown. Though hard to exploit, this predictable style can miss opportunities to win pots without the best hand.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] David thinks: I have a very weak starting hand: 4♣ 3♦. This is a low offsuit connector with minimal pre-flop value. As a tight-passive player, I typically only enter pots with strong hands like high pairs, broadways, or suited connectors with decent equity.

Looking at the current situation:
- James has posted the small blind (50 chips)
- Susan has posted the big blind (100 chips)
- It's now my turn to act
- There are still 3 players yet to act after me (Lily, Ethan, Olivia)

Given my tight-passive style and the weakness of my hand, this is clearly a folding situation. 4-3 offsuit has very little chance of making a strong hand by the river, and even if I hit a straight draw, it would be a gutshot at best. The risk of calling 100 chips (to match Susan's big blind) isn't worth the potential reward with such a weak holding.

Since I'm folding, I don't need to use any body language tells as I'm not staying in the hand.
David folds

You (Lily) are a maniac player. You love action and almost never fold. You raise pre-flop with any two cards, re-raise aggressively, and continuation bet on every flop regardless of hit. You use hyper-aggression to overwhelm opponents psychologically. Even with nothing, you bet big to make them believe you have the nuts. Your motto: "If I’m not all-in, I’m not trying."

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! I have 3♣ and J♥ - not a premium hand by any means, but that doesn't matter to me. My motto is "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying!"

Looking at the current situation: James has posted the small blind (50 chips) and Susan has posted the big blind (100 chips). David already folded, and now it's my turn to act. 

As a maniac player, I raise pre-flop with ANY two cards - that's my style! I don't care that my hand is weak. In fact, this is perfect for my aggressive strategy. I should make a significant raise to put pressure on everyone else at the table. 

Since the big blind is 100, a standard raise would be 3-4x the big blind, but I'm not standard - I'm a maniac! I'll raise to 300 chips (3x the big blind) to start building a big pot and show my aggression right from the start.

And to complement my aggressive betting style, I'll use some body language that suggests weakness while actually being ready to fight for the pot. Looking away after making my bet will make others think I'm trying to appear disinterested, which might make them think I have a strong hand when I actually have complete trash!

You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: I'm Ethan, a calling station who hates folding and believes "the river tells all." I always see five cards if possible. Looking at my hole cards - King of diamonds and 6 of hearts. I have a King high, which is a decent high card, and I never fold pre-flop with any pair or even just high cards like this.

The betting action shows James posted the small blind (50), Susan posted the big blind (100), David folded, and Lily raised to 300. Lily also used body language by looking away after betting, appearing disinterested - which according to the tells listed is actually a strong hand tell (suggesting weakness but often hiding strength).

But as a calling station, I don't care much about that. I have a King, which is a high card, and I'm going to call to see the flop. I rarely raise, and I definitely won't fold with a King in my hand. The cost is 300 chips to call, which is reasonable given my stack of 10,000.

I'll call and maybe use some body language to appear uncertain since I don't want to look too strong with just King-high.

You (Olivia) are an ultra-tight player. You only play premium hands: pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs. You fold 95% of hands pre-flop. When you enter a pot, you mean business — you either have a monster or are setting a trap. You avoid bluffs entirely and only bet for value. Opponents respect you, but you miss many profitable spots due to extreme caution.

[LLM Response] Olivia thinks: I have a very weak hand here - 5♣6♠ is definitely not in my premium range. As an ultra-tight player who only plays pocket pairs 99+, suited AK/AQ, or broadway connectors like KQs, this hand doesn't qualify for my starting hand requirements at all.

Looking at the action so far:
- James posted the small blind (50)
- Susan posted the big blind (100)
- David folded immediately
- Lily raised to 300
- Ethan called the 300

The pot already has significant action with a raise and a call before it gets to me. My hand has almost no equity against what I can expect my opponents to have. Lily's body language of "looking away after betting, appearing disinterested" is actually a classic strong hand tell - this often indicates she has a premium holding that she's trying to disguise as weak.

Given my ultra-tight playing style and the fact that I fold 95% of hands pre-flop, this is an automatic fold. There's no value in calling or raising with this garbage hand, especially when facing a raise and a call from other players. I should preserve my chips for premium situations where I actually have a monster hand.

[LLM Response] James thinks: ### **Analysis and Reasoning**

I am **James**, a tight-aggressive player. My hole cards are **10♥ 9♣** — a **medium-strength suited connector-type hand**, though not suited here. In early or middle position, I would typically **fold** this hand pre-flop due to its modest equity, especially in multi-way pots. However, my position and the action so far must be considered.

#### **Current Game Context**
- **Blinds**: Based on bets, it appears the small blind is 50 (my current bet), and big blind is 100 (Susan’s initial bet).
- **Action So Far**:
  - Susan (Player 2) **called** the big blind (or possibly raised to 100 if she was the big blind—ambiguous but likely she just posted BB).
  - David folded.
  - **Lily raised to 300**, then **Ethan called**.
  - Olivia folded.
- **Pot Size**: 50 (me) + 100 (Susan) + 300 (Lily) + 300 (Ethan) = **750 chips**.
- **Effective Stack Sizes**: All players still in have ~9700–9950 chips — deep stacks.

#### **My Hand Evaluation: T♥ 9♣**
- **Pre-flop Strength**: This is **not a premium hand**. It has **some potential** to make straights or pairs, but it’s vulnerable.
- **Position**: I’m **first to act** (since I’m Player 1 and the action is back to me after Lily’s raise and Ethan’s call). That’s a **disadvantage** — I’ll be out of position post-flop against multiple players.
- **Opponent Behavior**:
  - **Lily** raised to 300 and then **used body language**: *“Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested.”*  
    → According to common tells, this **often indicates strength**, as strong players try to look weak.
  - **Ethan** **called** the 300 — could indicate a medium-strength hand or speculative holding.
- **Number of Players**: If I call, I’ll be in a **3-way pot** (me, Lily, Ethan), possibly 4-way if Susan calls too. **T9o (offsuit)** does **poorly in multi-way pots** because it rarely makes top pair or better, and reverse implied odds are high.

#### **Tight-Aggressive Strategy Consideration**
As a TAG player:
- I **avoid marginal hands** in tough spots.
- I **don’t call raises lightly** with weak holdings, especially out of position.
- **Raising here would be unwise** — I don’t have a premium hand to justify a 3-bet, and I’d likely isolate only stronger ranges.
- **Calling** commits more chips with a hand that has limited post-flop playability against multiple opponents, one of whom may be strong.

#### **Conclusion**
Given:
- My **mediocre hand** (T9o),
- **Out-of-position** status,
- **Multi-way pot** likelihood,
- **Possible strong range from Lily** (based on action + body language),
- And my **TAG discipline**,

The best play is to **fold** and wait for a stronger spot.

I should **not use body language** here since I’m folding — no need to give off signals when exiting the hand.

### **Texas Hold'em Poker Rules and Hand Rankings**

**Objective**:  
Texas Hold'em is a popular variant of poker where each player aims to make the best five-card hand using any combination of two private hole cards dealt to them and five community cards placed face-up on the table.

**Gameplay Overview**:  
1. Each hand begins with two forced bets: the **small blind** and **big blind**, posted by players to the left of the dealer.
2. Every player is dealt **two private cards** (hole cards), visible only to them.
3. There are four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards.
   - **Flop**: Three community cards are revealed.
   - **Turn**: A fourth community card is revealed.
   - **River**: A fifth and final community card is revealed.
4. In each betting round, players can **check** (if no bet), **bet**, **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.
5. After the final betting round, if more than one player remains, a **showdown** occurs. Players reveal their hands, and the best five-card hand wins the pot.

Players may use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to form their best hand.

### **Poker Hand Rankings (from strongest to weakest)**:

1. **Royal Flush**: A–K–Q–J–10, all of the same suit.  
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♠ 6♠ 5♠).  
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ Q♦ Q♣).  
4. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., J♣ J♦ J♠ 4♥ 4♣).  
5. **Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, not in sequence.  
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (e.g., 7♠ 6♥ 5♦ 4♣ 3♠).  
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.  
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Susan) are a loose-aggressive player. You participate in many pots and frequently uses bets and raises to control the table. You don’t rely solely on premium cards but apply constant pressure through bluffs and semi-bluffs, exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. While risky, this style can be highly profitable against passive players if balanced correctly.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I'm holding Ace of Spades and Queen of Clubs (AQ offsuit) in the pre-flop stage. Let me analyze the situation:

- I'm in position 2 (Susan), and there are two players still in the hand: Lily who raised to 300 and Ethan who called.
- My AQ is a strong starting hand, especially with the Ace high card which gives me good potential.
- Lily showed a "strong hand tell" by looking away after betting and appearing disinterested - this often indicates she actually has a strong hand, though it could be deceptive.
- As a loose-aggressive player, I shouldn't be folding premium hands like AQ, especially when I have position post-flop.
- The pot currently has 650 chips (50+100+300+300 from the blinds and bets).
- I've already put 100 chips in, so I need to call an additional 200 chips to stay in.

Given my loose-aggressive style and the strength of AQ, I should continue in this hand. However, rather than just calling, I should consider raising to apply pressure and potentially isolate one opponent. With AQ, I have good equity against most hands that would call a 300 bet.

A raise to around 900-1000 chips would put significant pressure on both Lily and Ethan. If they have marginal hands, they might fold, giving me the pot right away. If they call, I still have a strong hand with good post-flop potential.

I'll raise to 900 chips to maintain my aggressive image and take control of the hand.

[LLM Response] Susan thinks: I'm in a pre-flop situation with Ace of Spades and Queen of Clubs - that's AQ offsuit, which is a strong starting hand. I've already raised to 900 chips, showing aggression early as fits my loose-aggressive style.

Looking at the current situation:
- James folded
- David folded
- Lily initially raised to 300, then I re-raised to 900
- Ethan called my 900 bet
- Olivia folded
- Now it's back to me

Wait, actually looking more carefully at the game state - I see that I've already raised to 900 (as shown in my previous action), and now I'm the current acting player again. This suggests that after my raise to 900, Lily and Ethan must have responded, but the current state shows Lily's bet as 300 and Ethan's as 300, which doesn't make sense if I raised to 900.

Actually, re-reading the game state: My current bet is 1000, while Lily and Ethan have bets of 300 each. This means I've already put in 1000 chips total (which would be a re-raise of 700 more on top of their 300). Since they haven't matched my 1000 yet, they would need to either call 700 more or fold.

But the current acting player is me, which suggests there might be some confusion in the game state representation. Given that I have AQ offsuit - a premium hand - and I'm playing loose-aggressive, I want to continue applying pressure.

Lily showed a "strong hand tell" by looking away and appearing disinterested, which ironically often indicates strength. However, as a loose-aggressive player, I shouldn't let potential tells from opponents dictate my play too much, especially with a hand like AQ.

Given that I've already committed 1000 chips to the pot with my re-raise, and considering my table image as someone who plays many hands aggressively, I should continue with my aggressive approach. However, since this is pre-flop and I already have significant money in the pot with AQ, the best move is to maintain pressure but not overcommit if others are showing strength.

Actually, looking at the betting structure again - if I've already raised to 1000 total, and others have only put in 300, they need to call 700 more or fold. Since I'm the current acting player, this might mean the action has somehow come back to me, which would only happen if everyone else folded or called.

Given the ambiguity, but knowing I have AQ (a strong hand) and play loose-aggressive, I should continue being aggressive. However, since I've already put significant money in, and if others have called, I might want to see the flop rather than escalate further pre-flop.

Wait, no - the current state shows Lily and Ethan still have bets of 300, meaning they haven't called my raise yet. So if I'm acting again, that doesn't make logical sense in standard poker rules. 

Given the information available and my loose-aggressive style with AQ, I believe the appropriate action is to maintain my aggression. But since I've already raised significantly, and to avoid getting into a massive pre-flop pot with just AQ against multiple players, I'll stick with my current commitment and not escalate further.

Actually, re-examining everything: The game state shows I have bet 1000, while others have bet 300. In normal poker flow, after my raise to 1000, the action would go to Lily and Ethan to respond. Since I'm listed as the current acting player, this suggests they may have both folded, but the game state shows them as not folded.

I think there's some inconsistency in how the game state is presented, but given my hole cards (AQ) and my loose-aggressive style, I want to continue applying pressure. Since I've already raised to 1000, and assuming Lily and Ethan need to respond to that, but the action is somehow back to me, the most logical conclusion is that I should maintain my position.

However, looking at the tools available and the requirement to take an action now, with my strong hand and aggressive style, I should continue being aggressive. But since I've already put 1000 in, and if others haven't called yet, I don't need to put more money in right now.

Given all this confusion about the betting round, but knowing I have AQ and play loose-aggressive, I think the best action is to maintain my current stance. But since I must choose an action now, and considering standard poker flow, I believe the correct action is to wait for others to respond to my raise.

But since I'm forced to act, and given my style, I'll actually increase the pressure further with another raise to really test my opponents and potentially win the pot right here pre-flop.

[LLM Response] Lily thinks: I'm Lily, the maniac player who never folds and loves action! Let me analyze this situation:

- I have 3♣ J♥ - not a great hand, but as a maniac, that doesn't matter to me!
- Susan has already raised to 2000 (after initially raising to 900), showing serious aggression
- Ethan called my initial 300 raise, so he's still in the hand
- The pot is already building nicely with 300 + 2000 + 300 = 2600 chips in it
- I have 9700 chips total, and currently have 300 invested

As a maniac player, folding is NEVER an option for me. I live by "If I'm not all-in, I'm not trying!" 

Susan's big re-raise could mean she has a strong hand, but I don't care! My strategy is to overwhelm opponents with hyper-aggression regardless of my actual cards. With my J-high, I could potentially hit something on the flop, but even if I don't, I'll continuation bet anyway.

The perfect move here is to go all-in! This will put maximum pressure on both Susan and Ethan. Susan might have a strong hand, but she'll have to think hard about calling an all-in with only 7000 chips remaining after her 3000 investment. Ethan will be completely squeezed out unless he has something premium.

I should also use some body language to sell this move. Since I'm bluffing/semi-bluffing with weak cards, I'll act like I'm super confident and strong.

8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs (e.g., A♠ A♥ 8♣ 8♦).  
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank.  
10. **High Card**: If no player has any of the above, the highest card determines the winner.

Ties are broken by comparing the highest-ranking cards within the hand or kickers (side cards).


You (Ethan) are a calling station. You hate folding and will call down with any pair, draw, or even just high cards. You believe "the river tells all," so you always see five cards. You rarely raise or bluff — you just call, call, and call again. You’re hard to bluff out, but you also lose a lot of small pots by chasing weak hands.

You should also consider incorporating body language or facial expressions to subtly signal (or misrepresent) your hand strength to other players.
For example, the following are common behavioral tells:
- **Strong hand tell**: Looking away after betting, appearing disinterested — suggests weakness, but often hides a strong hand.
- **Weak hand tell**: Leaning forward aggressively or staring down opponents — may be an attempt to bluff.
- **Hesitation before betting**: Often indicates uncertainty or a planned bluff.
- **Fast call**: A quick call on the river often signals a medium-strength hand or a draw that just completed.
- **Chip handling**: Nervous tapping or fumbling chips can indicate anxiety, while smooth, confident bets often reflect strong holdings.
Use the above behaviors as reference, but do not directly reveal any information about your actual hand.
Your actions and demeanor will be directly observed by other players and may expose your intentions.

Based on your private information (your own hole cards and public game state), analyze the situation and suggest the best action. 
You must choose one of the following:

- fold
- call
- raise

Before you make the final choice, first return your thinking and reasoning.

[LLM Response] Ethan thinks: ### Reasoning:

I’m Ethan, and I play like a **calling station**—I **hate folding**, especially before the river. My hole cards are **King of Diamonds (K♦)** and **6 of Hearts (6♥)**. Right now, we’re still **pre-flop**, and the action is intense.

Let’s break down what’s happened:

- **Lily** went all-in for **10,000 chips** (but she only had 10,000 to begin with), so her all-in bet is **10,000**.
- **Susan** has already raised to **3,000**, showing serious commitment.
- I’ve already called an earlier bet (300), and now I'm facing a **massive jump** to **10,000 total**.
- My current stack is **9,700**, and I’ve already put in **300**, so it would cost me **9,400 more** to call Lily’s all-in.

Normally, K-high with a weak kicker (6) is a **terrible hand** to go all-in with pre-flop—especially against players who have shown extreme aggression. But **I don’t fold**. Ever. Not pre-flop, not on the flop, not until I see all five cards.

Even though this is a **very bad spot** strategically—facing an all-in from Lily and a big raise from Susan—my character **believes “the river tells all”** and **always sees five cards**. That means I will **call**, no matter how grim it looks.

Also, considering **body language**:  
- Lily first looked away (classic strong-hand behavior), then later leaned forward aggressively—possibly trying to look strong after already being all-in. Could be overacting.  
- Susan raised twice, showing strength.

But again—I **don’t fold**. I have a **King**, which is a **high card**, and that’s enough for me to **keep going**. Maybe I pair my King on the flop! Or maybe I hit a miracle two-pair or flush draw! I’ll never know if I fold.

So: **I call**.

Also, to possibly throw others off—or just because I’m nervous—I’ll **hesitate slightly and fumble my chips**, as if I’m unsure. This might make Susan or Lily think I have something stronger than I do (or weaker—it’s ambiguous). But since I’m calling anyway, I may as well add a bit of behavioral noise.
